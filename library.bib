abstract = {In a crystal without symmetry elements and containing a sufficiently large number of atoms the probability of the hkl reflexion having an intensity between I and I + dI is P(I) dI, where P(I) = [Sigma]-1 exp{-I/[Sigma]}, and [Sigma] is the sum of the squares of the scattering factors of the atoms. In a centrosymmetric crystal the probability of the structure amplitude of the hkl reflexion lying between F and F + dF is P(F) dF, where P(F) = (2[pi][Sigma])½ exp{-F2/2[Sigma]}, a result noticed empirically. In a centred crystal (k-1)/k of the reflexions are zero, and the remaining 1/k of them are distributed like those of an uncentred crystal with parameterk[Sigma], where k is 4 for face-centring and 2 for end- or body-centring. Other symmetry elements do not produce important effects on the general reflexions, but may make a zone or line of intensities behave as if centred or centrosymmetric. The mean value of I is [Sigma], a fact that can be used to put relative intensities on an absolute basis. The mean values of |F| or I2 can also be used, but the mean value of I is the only one independent of the symmetry. The difference between the ratios of <|F|>2 or <I> for centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric crystals may serve for the purely X-ray determination of a centre of symmetry.},

abstract = {The low-temperature X-ray diffraction studies of orthorhombic insulin citrate crystals reported here were initially undertaken because of the rapid deterioration at room temperature of certain insulin crystals containing heavy-metal cations. The effects of cooling on mosaic character and radiation sensitivity were studied. Two temperature ranges were employed: (a) below-150'C and (b) 00C to-13'C. In normal laboratory practice orthorhombic insulin citrate crystals are grown and stored at 1 d 10C. Immersion studies in heavy-atom reagents are also made at this temperature. All X-ray diffraction work is, however, carried out at room temperature (.210C). We have found that orthorhombic insulin citrate crystals may be cooled rapidly to below-150'C without impairing the X-ray diffraction pattern. Rapid cooling does, however, enhance the mosaic character of these crystals. X-ray diffraction studies at 00C and-13'C have provided evidence for marked reduction in radiation sensitivity in certain heavy-atom-containing crystals. General Background.-Although metal-free insulin crystals are somewhat more sensitive to radiation damage (nickel-filtered CuKa) at room temperature than at 00C, the radiation sensitivity at room temperature is not marked enough to prevent the collection of intensity data by counter techniques. ' Furthermore, these crystals do not deteriorate on standing at room temperature for several weeks without irradiation. However, after immersion (1 ± 1"C) in buffered solutions containing certain salts with heavy-metal cations (including uranyl) insulin crystals deteriorate rapidly at room temperature (sometimes within 1 day or less of exposure) after only the minimal radiation exposure (minutes) necessary to monitor the state of the crystal. The deterioration has been observed both in the presence and in the absence of significant changes in X-ray diffraction intensity distribution after immersion. It is not markedly accelerated by continuous X-ray irradiation. This deterioration was originally attributed to greatly enhanced radiation damage, as laboratory practice avoids keeping the crystals at room temperature prior to X-ray photography. Some apparent enhancement in radiation damage is also observed with a second group of metal-containing crystals which do not show the striking and rapid room-temperature deterioration reported above. Before the deterioration in the first class of crystals was recognized as largely of thermal origin, studies were made of both classes of metal-containing crystals into which radiation protectors had been introduced. These provided marginal evidence of protection. There was no evidence of protection when the crystals were studied under oxygen-free conditions. In order to collect X-ray data from the crystals which deteriorate rapidly at room temperature, it would have been necessary to build an apparatus to maintain 1746},

It involves the replacement of the normal crystal mother liquor with salt-free aqueous/organic liquids of low freezing point. Detailed knowledge of the physical chemical properties of these mixed solvents permits conditions to be chosen that maximize the similarity between their micro-environments and that provided by the normal mother liquor. Since the mixed solvents remain fluid at very low temperatures, it is possible to diffuse substrates into the crystals in the cold. Results have been obtained for a dozen different crystalline proteins, demonstrating that the crystals diffract to high resolution after repeated cooling to below-70°C. At low temperatures radiation damage to all the crystals is negligible, and for two proteins there is an improvement in the intensities of high resolution reflections. The technique requires no special equipment, does not change unit cell dimensions, and does not demand cross-linking the crystals.},

abstract = {X-ray diffraction photographs of protein single crystals have been obtained using synchrotron radiation produced by an electron-positron storage ring. The diffracted intensities observed with this unconventional source are a factor of at least 60 greater than those obtained with a sealed x-ray tube using the same crystal and instrumental parameters. Diffraction data have been collected by the precession method to higher resolution and using smaller protein crystals than would have been possible with a conventional source. The crystal decay rate in the synchrotron beam for several proteins appears to be substantially less than that observed with Ni-fiftered Cu radiation. The tunable nature of 'the source (which allows selective optimization of anomalous contributions to the scattering factors) and the low angular divergence of the beam make the source very useful for single crystal protein diffraction studies. The use of synchrotron radiation as a source for single crystal x-ray diffraction studies has recently been the subject of considerable discussion and controversy. In contrast to conventional sources, the polychromatic radiation produced by synchrotron emission can be monochromated over a large range of wavelengths to give an intense x-ray beam. Questions have been raised about the actual gain in diffracted intensity which is possible over more conventional sources and the ability of biological materials (such as protein crystals) to withstand the high radiation flux.},

abstract = {A general model is derived to describe the rate of radiation damage in protein crystals. This model and some of its special cases are tested against the Blake and Phillips data on X-irradiation effects in myoglobin crystals. The results point to a sequential process of damage and suggest an improved method for correcting diffraction data for the effects of radiation damage. Exposure of protein crystals to X-rays for the measurement of diffraction intensities causes appreciable damage, as is manifest in the deterioration of diffraction patterns. On average, the intensity of reflections decreases with exposure time and does so most markedly at higher scattering angles. Irradiation of myoglobin crystals has an effect equivalent to the damaging or destroying of 160 molecules by each CuKa quantum that is absorbed (Blake & Phillips, 1962). Radiation damage is even more severe for many other proteins. The study by Blake & Phillips (1962) suggests that after a given dose of radiation, the diffraction pattern derives from a crystal which consists of three components: an essentially undamaged fraction A,, a highly disordered fraction A, which contributes significantly only at low angles, and an effectively amorphous fraction A, which no longer scatters coherently. If the disordering is assumed to be random, with mean-square atomic displacement of D/S 'IT, then the scattering from disordered molecules will be attenuated relative to that from native molecules by a factor exp(-Ds2), where s = si&/h. Thus the relation of intensity, I(t), of diffraction after exposure t to the initial intensity is governed by the law I(t)/I(O) = A,(t) + A,(t) exp(-Ds2). (1)},

Improved specimen preparation methods are described which achieve the production of very thin aqueous films with the hydrated specimen embedded in them. Defocused bright field images of frozen, hydrated protein crystals possess a surprisingly high contrast, presumably due to the difference in density of the protein and the aqueous phase. The techniques described have been used to study the crystal structure of hydrated catalase and the outermost cell wall of Spirillum serpens. 1978 Blackwell Science Ltd},

abstract = {In the jellyfish Aequorea, the green-fluorescent protein (GFP) functions as the in civo bio-luminescence emitter via energy transfer from the photoprotein aequorin. Accumulated evidence has indicated that the Aequorea G F P is a relatively inflexible protein. Present evidence, however, indicates that the chromophore environment is readily accessible to a variety of external perturbants. Native Aeyuorea G F P has an absorbance maximum at 395 nm and a shoulder at 470 nm. In low ionic strength buffer at neutral pH and room temperature the 395/470 nm absorbance ratio is about 2.0. We show that this ratio is highly variable depending upon temperature, ionic strength, protein concentration, and pH. A maximum ratio of 6.5 (at a protein concentration of 18.6 mg/m/) and minimum of 0.42 (at a pH of 12.2) have been measured. In the latter case, the resulting absorption and excitation spectra resemble those of Renilla G F P in spectral shape (but not wavelength maximum). In all cases as the perturbant is varied the resulting spectra pass through a sharp isosbestic point, suggesting a relatively simple two-state mechanism. These spectral perturbations are fully reversible. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the chromophore binding site is conformationally flexible. pH-Dependent changes in the near-UV and visible circular dichroism spectra plus spectrophotometric titration of tyrosine residues lend additional support to this hypothesis.},

The orientation of the loci relative to the axes of the diagram indicates the functional dependence of the particular component (see Mathieson, 1983a, b). The length of the locus corresponds to the range of the component, the magnitude of the component varying along it. In this diagram, Fig. 3(a), the locus of the crystal size component, c, is indicated by the thick line terminated by an arrow. (Ato, A20 I°$\sim$) = (ac,2accos20). Since the co/0-and tn/20-scan-mode diagrams, Figs. 3(b) and (c), respectively, are related to the $\sim$o-scan-mode diagram by a simple affine transformation (see Mathieson, 1983c), we can locate the locus of the c component in these figures. Hence we readily deduce the relationship between scan range and aperture size given in Table 2. This derivation shows not only the magnitude of the required aperture but also the direction of the range relative to the origin of the diagram, this origin, in practice, being the centre of the main peak of the intensity distribution. In the right-hand side of column 3 of Table 2 are given alternative formulae which indicate more directly the relationship between the three scan modes. The results in column 3 also indicate that self-consistency is compatible with the cosZO/sin20 relationship but not with the cos P/sin 0 relationship recorded in Table 1. Abstract A simple technique has been developed to lessen radiation damage of protein crystals grown from low-ionic-strength solution. The technique consists of replacing the mother liquor with solutions containing 10-20% of polyethylene glycol 4000 or 20000.},

In the determination of the structures of crystalline proteins the diffraction patterns have traditionally been recorded with Cu K X-radiation. Even at synchrotron radiation sources most of the work has been with wavelengths of about 1"5 A. The main reason for this preference has been that crystals are most readily grown with linear dimensions t of between 0.3 and 0-8 mm; the linear absorption coefficient # is typically about 0.8 mm-X for Cu K X-rays, so that conditions are not too far removed from the condition for maximum diffracted intensity, t= 1//$\sim$. (1) In addition, photographic film is much less sensitive, and multiple-film pack methods to extend the dynamic range are more difficult to employ, at wavelengths shorter than 1.54 $\sim$,.

abstract = {The use of frozen hydrated specimens for molecular structure determination is limited primarily by radiation damage. The radiation damage effect in frozen hydrated catalase crystals has been measured in terms of the loss of electron diffraction. The results show an improvement for this type or:specimen relative to wet hydrated or to glucose embedded catalase crystals at room temperature. Bright field images of unstained, frozen hydrated catalase crystals extend to a resolution of 11.5/$\sim$. The image resolution is presently limited by design problems with the liquid nitroge n cooled specimen stage. Rather high contrast is present in these images of unstained biological material, presumably due to the 30% difference in mass density between ice and protein. The improved resistance to radiation damage also makes it possible to give better statistical definition to the image, thereby making the image features easier to see. The study of macromolecular structure at the level of atomic resolution is a major goal of electron microscopy. To achieve this with biological objects requires both that the structure of the specimen be preserved unaltered in the high vacuum of the microscope and that the structural data themselves be recorded in such a manner that the effects of radiation damage are minimized. Ideally, the former condition is best satisfied by maintaining a sufficient level of hydration. The feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated with both room temperature hydration stages (3) and with frozen, hydrated specimens (18). In addition to hydrated specimen techniques, it has been recently demonstrated that crystalline disorder, which usually occurs on drying, can be prevented through substitution of the aqueous phase by various sugars (21). All of these methods preserve the crystalline structure of catalase to at least 3.5 A resolution. Other methods of specimen preparation, such as embedding with water soluble compounds (12, 16), would clearly represent an improvement over conventional procedures. However, none of these methods has as yet been shown to preserve crystalline structure to the high resolution that can be obtained with wet specimens, with frozen},

By analogy with X-ray methods, it is possible that heavy-atom labelling of the membrane crystal may provide heavy-atom derivatives that can be used for phasing by the multiple isomorphous replacement method. This paper describes the screening of heavy-atom compounds as potential derivatives, and the evaluation of the data collected from these heavy-atom-labelled membranes. :Improvements in the methods for collecting electron diffraction data and analysing and merging the data are presented. Diffraction patterns of purple membrane samples were taken at-120°C to minimize radiation damage. About 30 heavy-atom compounds were tested for use as potential derivatives. The diffraction patterns from labelled membranes were analysed by examining 6"5 A difference Fourier maps. Two heavy-atom compounds were selected for three-dimensionM data collection at 3 A resolution. In addition, a full set of native data at-120°C was collected to 2.7 A resolution. The intensity merging, heavy-atom derivative evaluation, heavy-atom refinement and the calculation of phases are presented. Phases are compared to those determined by electron microscope imaging, and limitations of the method are discussed. It is concluded that, with the present accuracy of data collection and the present magnitude of AF/F available for the derivatives, the phasing power is too small. The phases that are obtained are not sufficiently accurate to provide a reliably interpretable map. It may be possible, however, to use the heavy=atom derivative data in difference Fourier calculations in which the presence of a peak would confirm the phases calculated from a model or obtained by electron microscope imaging.},

The calculation, which depends on the assumption that electrons and X-rays are more or less equally damaging to the structure giving rise to the diffraction at very low temperature, supports experimental observations that X-ray diffraction from protein crystals seems to last indefinitely at liquid nitrogen temperatures, even in the most powerful beams available at synchrotron X-ray sources.

Despite stereochemical restraints, it is possible to overfit or 'misfit' the diffraction data: an incorrect model can be refined to fairly good R values as several recent examples have shown. Here I propose a reliable and unbiased indicator of the accuracy of such models. By analogy with the cross-validation method of testing statistical models I define a statistical quantity (R(free) (T) that measures the agreement between observed and computed structure factor amplitudes for a 'test' set of reflections that is omitted in the modelling and refinement process. As examples show, there is a high correlation between R(free) (T) and the accuracy of the atomic model phases. This is useful because experimental phase information is usually inaccurate, incomplete or unavailable. I expect that R(free) (T) will provide a measure of the information content of recently proposed models of thermal motion and disorder, time-averaging and bulk solvent},

abstract = {Structures using X-ray diffraction data collected to 1-5-A resolution have been determined for the protein ribonuclease-A at nine different temperatures ranging from 98 to 320 K. It is determined that the protein molecule expands slightly (0.4% per 100 K) with increasing temperature and that this expansion is linear. The expansion is due primarily to subtle repacking of the molecule, with exposed and mobile loop regions exhibiting the largest movements. Individual atomic Debye-Waller factors exhibit predominantly biphasic behavior, with a small positive slope a t low temperatures and a larger positive slope a t higher temperatures. The break in this curve occurs at a characteristic temperature of 180-200 K, perhaps indicative of fundamental changes in the dynamical structure of the surrounding protein solvent. The distribution of protein Debye-Waller factors is observed to broaden as well as shift to higher values as the temperature is increased. Temperature controls the average structural and dynamical properties of molecules. X-ray crystallography provides a powerful technique to obtain high-resolution models of the average molecular structure and to examine the spatial distribution of atomic motions. High-resolution X-ray crystallography carried out as a function of temperature allows one, in principle, to explore the physical-chemical nature of molecular topography and to probe the subtle balance of bonded and nonbonded forces that stabilize structure and control dynamics. Multiple-temperature crystallography has been used recently to study the effects of temperature on the structure and dynamics of the all a-helical protein myoglobin from sperm whale (Frauenfelder et al., 1979, 1987; Hartmann et al., 1982). Analysis of two structures determined with data collected at 80 and 300 K indicates that an increasing temperature results in an anisotropic expansion of 2-376 in protein volume with a nonuniform increase in atomic motions as measured by individual Debye-Waller factors. Analysis of the expansion revealed that surface loops are involved and that the volume increase is distributed into subatomic-sized spaces rather than larger water-sized cavity spaces. The larger Debye-Waller factors at 300 K were attributed to the increased magnitude of vibrational motions and the increased distribution of con-formational microstates. Structures of myoglobin at several intermediate temperatures have also been investigated (Parak et al., 1987). Because myoglobin is composed entirely of a-helices packed around a large, planar prosthetic group, we +This work was supported by grants from the NIH (F32 AM07339 and GM38758). *The coordinates for the nine ribonuclease-A structures have been submitted to the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank under the names 1-9RAT.},

The complex formed crystals of the trigonal space group P3,21 which diffracted to a resolution of 250 pm. Each of the two mung bean protease reactive sites is bound to trypsin according to the standard mechanism for serine proteinase inhibition. The binding loops thereby adopt the canonical conformation for the standard mechanism; however, the sub-van der Waals contact between the active-site serine O Y (195) and the P1 carbonyl carbon of both loops is significantly smaller (210 pm) than hitherto observed, with continuous electron density connecting the two atoms. The inhibitor is formed by two double-stranded antiparal-lel P-sheets, which are connected into a moderately twisted P-sheet by a network of hydrogen bonds involving main-chain atoms and two water molecules. All contacts with neighbors in the crystal lattice occur between trypsin molecules. This apparently gives rise to an unusual form of disorder where the complexes pack in two orientations Ta : MaMb : Tb and Tb : MbMa : Ta (Ta, Tb = trypsin, Ma = mung bean loop I, Mb = mung bean loop II), such that the asymmetric unit consists of the ternary complex in two orientations, each with half occupancy. This is nearly equivalent to an asymmetric unit which has one trypsin molecule with full occupancy and one mung bean inhibitor with half occupancy and a crystallographic twofold symmetry axis through its center. Because of the approximate twofold symmetry of the inhibitor itself, however, the electron density was inter-pretable for most of the inhibitor (17 residues at the termini were not resolved) and shows evidence of its double orientation.},

Cloning of the cDNA and heterologous expression of fluorescent protein in a wide variety of organisms indicate that this unique posttranslational modification must be either spontaneous or dependent only on ubiquitous enzymes and reactants. We report that formation of the final fluorophore requires molecular oxygen and proceeds with a time constant (approximately 4 hr at 22 degrees C and atmospheric pO2) independent of dilution, implying that the oxidation does not require enzymes or cofactors. GFP was mutagenized and screened for variants with altered spectra. The most striking mutant fluoresced blue and contained histidine in place of Tyr-66. The availability of two visibly distinct colors should significantly extend the usefulness of GFP in molecular and cell biology by enabling in vivo visualization of differential gene expression and protein localization and measurement of protein association by fluorescence resonance energy transfer.},

The fluorophores are protected inside the cylinders, and their structures are consistent with the formation of aromatic systems made up of Tyr"" with reduction of its Cu-CB bond coupled with cyclization of the neighboring glycine and serine residues. The environment Inside the cylinder explains the effects of many existing mutants of GFP and suggests specific side chains that could be modified to change the spectral properties of GFP.

abstract = {The green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the Pacific Northwest jellyfish Aequorea victoria has generated intense interest as a marker for gene expression and localization of gene products. The chromophore, resulting from the spontaneous cyclization and oxidation of the sequence-Ser65 (or Thr65)-Tyr66-Gly67-, requires the native protein fold for both formation and fluorescence emission. The structure of Thr65 GFP has been determined at 1.9 angstrom resolution. The protein fold consists of an 11-stranded barrel with a coaxial helix, with the chromophore forming from the central helix. Directed mutagenesis of one residue adjacent to the chromophore, Thr203, to Tyr or His results in significantly red-shifted excitation and emission maxima. Although the GFP of the Pacific Northwest jellyfish Aequoria victoria was discovered some time ago (1), the cloning (2) and heterologous expression (3) of its cDNA were the crucial steps that triggered the widespread and growing use of GFP as a reporter for gene expression and protein localization in a broad variety of organisms (4, 5). Wild-type GFP is a stable, proteoly-sis-resistant single chain of 238 residues and has two absorption maxima at about 395 and 475 nm. The relative amplitudes of these two peaks are sensitive to environmental factors (6) and illumination history (4), presumably reflecting two or more ground states. Excitation at the primary absorption peak of 395 nm yields an emission maximum at 508 nm with a quantum yield of 0.72 to 0.85 (1, 4-6). The fluoro-phore results from the autocatalytic cycliza-tion of the polypeptide backbone between residues Ser65 and Gly67 and oxidation of the ox-3 bond of Tyr66 (4, 7, 8). Mutation of Ser65 to Thr (S65T) (9) simplifies the ex-citation spectrum to a single peak at 488 nm of enhanced amplitude (10), which no longer shows signs of conformational iso-mers (4). As a step in understanding these properties, and to aid in the tailoring of GFPs with altered characteristics, we have determined the three-dimensional structure at 1.9 A resolution of the S65T mutant (10) of A. victoria GFP (11).},

The crystallographic R-factor is 18.1% for all data from 20 to 2.1 {\AA}, and the model geometry is excellent. The chromophore is non-native and is autocatalytically generated from the internal tripeptide Ser65-His66-Gly67. The final electron density maps indicate that the formation of the chromophore is complete, including 1,2 dehydration of His66 as indicated by the planarity of the chromophore. The chromophore is in the cis conformation, with no evidence for any substantial fraction of the trans configuration or uncyclized apoprotein, and is well-shielded from bulk solvent by the folded protein. These characteristics indicate that the machinery for production of the chromophore from a buried tripeptide unit is not only intact but also highly efficient in spite of a major change in chromophore chemical structure. Nevertheless, there are significant rearrangements in the hydrogen bond configuration around the chromophore as compared to wild-type, indicating flexibility of the active site. pH titration of the intact protein and the chromopeptide (pK a1) 4.9 (0.1, pK a2) 12.0 (0.1) suggests that the predominant form of the chromophore in the intact protein is electrically neutral.

abstract = {The 2.1-Å resolution crystal structure of wild-type green fluorescent protein and comparison of it with the recently determined structure of the Ser-65 → Thr (S65T) mutant explains the dual wavelength absorption and photoisomerization properties of the wild-type protein. The two absorption maxima are caused by a change in the ionization state of the chromophore. The equilibrium between these states appears to be governed by a hydrogen bond network that permits proton transfer between the chromophore and neighboring side chains. The predominant neutral form of the fluorophore maximally absorbs at 395 nm. It is maintained by the carboxylate of Glu-222 through electrostatic repulsion and hydrogen bonding via a bound water molecule and Ser-205. The ionized form of the fluorophore, absorbing at 475 nm, is present in a minor fraction of the native protein. Glu-222 donates its charge to the fluorophore by proton abstraction through a hydrogen bond network, involving Ser-205 and bound water. Further stabilization of the ionized state of the fluorophore occurs through a rearrangement of the side chains of Thr-203 and His-148. UV irradiation shifts the ratio of the two absorption maxima by pumping a proton relay from the neutral chromophore's excited state to Glu-222. Loss of the Ser-205–Glu-222 hydrogen bond and isomerization of neutral Glu-222 explains the slow return to the equilibrium dark-adapted state of the chromophore. In the S65T structure, steric hindrance by the extra methyl group stabilizes a hydrogen bonding network, which prevents ionization of Glu-222. Therefore the fluorophore is permanently ionized, causing only a 489-nm excitation peak. This new understanding of proton redistribution in green fluorescent protein should enable engineering of environmentally sensitive fluorescent indicators and UV-triggered fluorescent markers of protein diffusion and trafficking in living cells.},

abstract = {Background: Tryptase is a trypsin-like serine proteinase stored in the cytoplasmic granules of mast cells, which has been implicated in a number of mast cell related disorders such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. Unlike almost all other serine proteinases, tryptase is fully active in plasma and in the extracellular space, as there are no known natural inhibitors of tryptase in humans. Leech-derived tryptase inhibitor (LDTI), a protein of 46 amino acids, is the first molecule found to bind tightly to and specifically inhibit human tryptase in the nanomolar range. LDTI also inhibits trypsin and chymotrypsin with similar affinities. The structure of LDTI in complex with an inhibited proteinase could be used as a template for the development of low molecular weight tryptase inhibitors. Results: The crystal structure of the complex between trypsin and LDTI was solved at 2.0 {\AA} resolution and a model of the LDTI-tryptase complex was created, based on this X-ray structure. LDTI has a very similar fold to the third domain of the turkey ovomucoid inhibitor. LDTI interacts with trypsin almost exclusively through its binding loop (residues 3-10) and especially through the sidechain of the specificity residue Lys8. Our modeling studies indicate that these interactions are maintained in the LDTI-tryptase complex. Conclusions: The insertion of nine residues after residue 174 in tryptase, relative to trypsin and chymotrypsin, prevents inhibition by other trypsin inhibitors and is certainly responsible for the higher specificity of tryptase relative to trypsin. In LDTI, the disulfide bond between residues 4 and 25 causes a sharp turn from the binding loop towards the N terminus, holding the N terminus away from the 174 loop of tryptase.},

The nonclassical Kazal-type inhibitor exhibits the same overall architecture as that observed in solution and in rhodniin. The complex reveals structural aspects of the mast cell proteinase tryptase. The conformation of the binding region of rLDTI suggests that tryptase has a restricted active site cleft. The basic amino terminus of rLDTI, apparently flexible from previous NMR measurements , approaches the 148-loop of trypsin. This loop has an acidic equivalent in tryptase, suggesting that the basic amino terminus could make favorable electro-static interactions with the tryptase molecule. A series of rLDTI variants constructed to probe this hypothesis confirmed that the amino-terminal Lys-Lys sequence plays a role in inhibition of human lung tryptase but not of trypsin or chymotrypsin. The location of such an acidic surface patch is in accordance with the known low molecular weight inhibitors of tryptase.},

abstract = {Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) is a 36 kDa glycoprotein that helps maintain haemostasis by inhibiting Factor Xa and the Factor VIIa/ Tissue Factor (TF) complex. TFPI contains three tandemly linked Kunitz inhibitor domains, of which the second inhibits factor Xa. We have undertaken a multidisciplinary approach to study the structure and function of the second Kunitz domain of TFPI, with a view towards the rational design of factor Xa inhibitors. Amino acid residues 93 to 154 of the mature TFPI protein, corresponding to the second Kunitz domain (TFPI-kII), were expressed in Escherichia coli. The protein was puri{\textregistered}ed to near homogeneity by ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and size exclusion chromatography, respectively. TFPI-kII is a potent factor Xa in-hibitor with a K i of 1.5 {\^{A}} 10 {\`{A}}10 M, a value that does not differ signi{\textregistered}-cantly from that of intact TFPI. The three-dimensional structure of TFPI-kII in aqueous solution was determined by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). A set of 30 conformers was calculated with the program DIANA using 906 distance constraints derived from nuclear Overhauser effects and 23 dihedral angle constraints. This set, representing the solution structure of TFPI-kII, has an average root-mean-square deviation of 0.78 A {\^{E}} for the backbone atoms and 1.38 A {\^{E}} for all heavy atoms of residues 1 to 58. The structure of TFPI-kII has also been determined in complex with porcine trypsin using X-ray crystallographic techniques. The complex has been solved to a resolution of 2.6 A {\^{E}} , with a {\textregistered}nal R-factor of 16.2%. Comparison of the NMR derived structure with that of TFPI-kII in complex with trypsin reveals little divergence of the two structures, with the exception of residue Tyr17. Superposition of the tryp-sin:TFPI-kII complex on factor Xa provides insights into macromolecular determinants for the inhibition of factor Xa. Complexation would require a degree of reorganisation of factor Xa residues, in particular of TyrF99, but also perhaps of the F148-loop. The interaction was further investigated using restrained molecular dynamics. Electrostatic interactions would appear to play a major role. The reorganisation of factor Xa is in contrast to the proposed factor Xa:TAP interaction, where TAP would bind to th{\`{e}}`groundth{\`{e}}`ground state'' structure of factor Xa.},

abstract = {The Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor from soybean (STI) consists of 181 amino acid residues with two disulfide bridges. Its crystal structures have been determined in complex with porcine pancreatic trypsin in two crystal forms (an orthorhombic form at 1.75 A resolution and a tetragonal form at 1.9 A) and in the free state at 2.3 A resolution. They have been refined to crystallographic R-values of 18.9%, 21.6% and 19.8%, respectively. The three models of STI reported here represent a significant improvement over the partial inhibitor structure in the complex , which was previously determined at a nominal resolution of 2.6 A by the multiple isomorphous replacement method. This study provides the first high-resolution picture of the complex between a Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor with its cognate proteinase. Many of the external loops of STI show high B-factors, both in the free and the complexed states, except the reactive site loop whose B-factors are dramatically reduced upon complexation. The reactive site loop of STI adopts a canonical conformation similar to those in other substrate-like inhibitors. The P1 carbonyl group displays no out-of-plane displacement and thus retains a nominal trigonal planar geometry. Modeling studies on the complex between a homologous Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor DE-3 from Erythrina caffra and the human tissue-type plasminogen activator reveal a new insight into the speci{\textregistered}c interactions which could play a crucial role in their binding.},

abstract = {Background: Because of its ability to spontaneously generate its own fluorophore, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria is used extensively as a fluorescent marker in molecular and cell biology. The yellow fluorescent proteins (YFPs) have the longest wavelength emissions of all GFP variants examined to date. This shift in the spectrum is the result of a T203Y substitution (single-letter amino acid code), a mutation rationally designed on the basis of the X-ray structure of GFP S65T. Results: We have determined the crystal structures of YFP T203Y/S65G/V68L/S72A and YFP H148G to 2.5 and 2.6 {\AA} resolution, respectively. Both structures show clear electron density for nearly coplanar $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking between Tyr203 and the chromophore. The chromophore has been displaced by nearly 1 {\AA} in comparison to other available structures. Although the H148G mutation results in the generation of a solvent channel to the chromophore cavity, intense fluorescence is maintained. The chromophore in the intact protein can be titrated, and the two variants have pK a values of 7.0 (YFP) and 8.0 (YFP H148G). Conclusions: The observed red shift of the T203Y YFP variant is proposed to be mainly due to the additional polarizability of the $\pi$-stacked Tyr203. The altered location of the chromophore suggests that the exact positions of nearby residues are not crucial for the chemistry of chromophore formation. The YFPs significantly extend the pH range over which GFPs may be employed as pH indicators in live cells.},

The existing crystal structure data on serine proteases have not fully answered a number of fundamental questions relating to the catalytic activity of serine proteases. The new high resolution native porcine L-trypsin (BPT) structure is aimed at extending the knowledge on the conformation of the active site and the ordered water structure within and around the active site. The crystal structure of BPT has been determined at 1.63 A {\^{i}} resolution. An acetate ion bound at the active site of a trypsin molecule by both classical hydrogen bonds and C-HTO hydrogen bonds has been identified for the first time. A large network of water molecules extending from the recognition amino acid Asp-184 to the entry of the active site has been observed in the BPT structure. A detailed comparison with inhibitor complexes and autolysates indicates that the sulfate ion and the acetate ion bind at the same site of the trypsin molecule. The Ser-195 CL-OQ-His-57 NO angle in the catalytic triad of BPT is intermediate between the corresponding values of the complex and native structure due to acetate ion binding. The network of waters from the recognition amino acid to the active site entry is probably the first ever complete picture of functional waters around the active site. Structural comparisons show that the functional waters involved in the binding of small molecule inhibitors and protease inhibitors are distinctly different. {\ss}},

Batch crystallization plates were prepared at given solution concentrations and incubated at set temperatures over 1 week. The number of crystals per well with their size and axial ratios were recorded and correlated with solution conditions. Crystal numbers were found to increase with increasing supersaturation and temperature. The most significant variable, however, was pH; crystal numbers changed by two orders of magnitude over the pH range 4.0-5.2. Crystal size also varied with solution conditions, with the largest crystals obtained at pH 5.2. Having optimized the crystallization conditions, we prepared a batch of crystals under the same initial conditions, and 50 of these crystals were analyzed by x-ray diffraction techniques.

abstract = {The serine proteinase plasmin is, together with tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), involved in the dissolution of blood clots in a {\textregistered}brin-dependent manner. Moreover, plasmin plays a key role in a variety of other activation cascades such as the activation of metalloproteinases, and has also been implicated in wound healing, pathogen invasion, cancer invasion and metastasis. The leech-derived (Hirudo medicinalis) antistasin-type inhibitor bdellastasin represents a speci{\textregistered}c inhibitor of trypsin and plasmin and thus offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the concept of plasmin inhibition. The complexes formed between bdellastasin and bovine as well as porcine b-trypsin have been crystallised in a monoclinic and a tetragonal crystal form, containing six molecules and one molecule per asymmetric unit, respectively. Both structures have been solved and re{\textregistered}ned to 3.3 A {\^{E}} and 2.8 A {\^{E}} resolution. Bdellastasin turns out to have an antistasin-like fold exhibiting a bis-domainal structure like the tissue kallikrein inhibitor hirustasin. The interaction between bdellastasin and trypsin is restricted to the C-terminal subdomain of bdellastasin, particularly to its primary binding loop, comprising residues Asp30-Glu38. The reactive site of bdel-lastasin differs from other antistasin-type inhibitors of trypsin-like pro-teinases, exhibiting a lysine residue instead of an arginine residue at P1. A model of the bdellastasin-microplasmin complex has been created based on the X-ray structures. Our modelling studies indicate that both trypsin and microplasmin recognise bdellastasin by interactions which are characteristic for canonically binding proteinase inhibitors. On the basis of our three-dimensional structures, and in comparison with the tissue -kallikrein-bound and free hirustasin and the antistasin structures, we postulate that the binding of the inhibitors toward trypsin and plasmin is accompanied by a switch of the primary binding loop segment P5-P3. Moreover, in the factor Xa inhibitor antistasin, the core of the molecule would prevent an equivalent rotation of the P3 residue, making exosite interactions of antistasin with factor Xa imperative. Furthermore, Arg32 of antistasin would clash with Arg175 of plasmin, thus impairing a favourable antistasin-plasmin interaction and explaining its speci{\textregistered}city.

abstract = {The green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria has become a useful tool in molecular and cell biology. Recently, it has been found that the fluorescence spectra of most mutants of GFP respond rapidly and reversibly to pH variations, making them useful as probes of intracellular pH. To explore the structural basis for the titration behavior of the popular GFP S65T variant, we determined high-resolution crystal structures at pH 8.0 and 4.6. The structures revealed changes in the hydrogen bond pattern with the chromophore, suggesting that the pH sensitivity derives from protonation of the chromophore phenolate. Mutations were designed in yellow fluorescent protein (S65G/V68L/S72A/T203Y) to change the solvent accessibility (H148G) and to modify polar groups (H148Q, E222Q) near the chromophore, pH titrations of these variants indicate that the chromophore pK(a) can be modulated over a broad range from 6 to 8, allowing for pH determination from pH 5 to pH 9. Finally, mutagenesis was used to raise the pK(a) from 6.0 (S65T) to 7.8 (S65T/H148D). Unlike other variants, S65T/H148D exhibits two pH-dependent excitation peaks for green fluorescence with a clean isosbestic point. This raises the interesting possibility of using fluorescence at this isosbestic point as an internal reference. Practical real time in vivo applications in cell and developmental biology are proposed.},

abstract = {When light is scattered by an object there is an exchange of momentum which results in a net force being applied to the scatterer. Although relatively weak, optical forces can be significant for micro-objects in intense light fields. For example, milliwatts of laser power generate optical forces sufficient to levitate and transport 10 m particles. Applied to biological matter, optical force techniques offer the important advantage of permitting contactless, nonmechanical, in situ manipulation. By appropriate selection of the laser wavelength, radiation and thermal damage can be avoided. We describe a compact laser seeding apparatus by which individual crystal micro-seeds can be selected and transferred into a growth solution. The device allows for the rapid, reproducible transfer of single seeds. Other plausible uses of the seeding apparatus are seeding directly into capillary tubes and transfer of microcrystals into cryo-loops.},

abstract = {The mutant F99S/M153T/V163A of the Green Fluorescent Protein (c3-GFP) has spectral characteristics similar to the wild-type GFP, but it is 42-fold more fluorescent in vivo. Here, we report the crystal structure and the refolding properties of c3-GFP and compare them with those of the less fluorescent wt-GFP and S65T mutant. The topol-ogy and the overall structure of c3-GFP is similar to the wild-type GFP. The three mutated residues, Ser99, Thr153, and Ala163, lie on the surface of the protein in three different-strands. The side chains of Ser99 and Thr153 are exposed to the solvent, whereas that of Ala163 points toward the interior of the protein. No significant deviation from the structure of the wild-type molecule is found around these positions, and there is not clear evidence of any distortion in the position of the chromophore or of the surrounding residues induced by the mutated amino acids. In vitro refolding experiments on urea-denatured c3-GFP reveal a renaturation behavior similar to that of the S65T molecule, with kinetic constants of the same order of magnitude. We conclude that the higher fluorescence activity of c3-GFP can be attributed neither to particular structural features nor to a faster folding process, as previously proposed.},

@article{Burmeister2000,
abstract = {The high intensity of third-generation X-ray sources, along with the development of cryo-cooling of protein crystals at temperatures around 100 K, have made it possible to extend the diffraction limit of crystals and to reduce their size. However, even with cryo-cooled crystals, radiation damage becomes a limiting factor. So far, the radiation damage has manifested itself in the form of a loss of overall diffracted intensity and an increase in the temperature factor. The structure of a protein (myrosinase) after exposure to different doses of X-rays in the region of 20 {\^{A}} 10 15 photons mm {\`{A}}2 has been studied. The changes in the structure owing to radiation damage were analysed using Fourier difference maps and occupancy re{\textregistered}nement for the {\textregistered}rst time. Damage was obvious in the form of breakage of disul{\textregistered}de bonds, decarboxylation of aspartate and glutamate residues, a loss of hydroxyl groups from tyrosine and of the methylthio group of methionine. The susceptibility to radiation damage of individual groups of the same kind varies within the protein. The quality of the model resulting from structure determination might be compromised owing to the presence of radiolysis in the crystal after an excessive radiation dose. Radiation-induced structural changes may interfere with the interpretation of ligand-binding studies or MAD data. The experiments reported here suggest that there is an intrinsic limit to the amount of data which can be extracted from a sample of a given size.

@article{Ravelli2000,
abstract = {Background: Exposure of biomacromolecules to ionising radiation results in damage that is initiated by free radicals and progresses through a variety of mechanisms. A widely used technique to study the three-dimensional structures of biomacromolecules is crystallography, which makes use of ionising X-rays. It is crucial to know to what extent structures determined using this technique might be biased by the inherent radiation damage. Results: The consequences of radiation damage have been investigated for three dissimilar proteins. Similar results were obtained for each protein, atomic B factors increase, unit-cell volumes increase, protein molecules undergo slight rotations and translations, disulphide bonds break and decarboxylation of acidic residues occurs. All of these effects introduce non-isomorphism. The absorbed dose in these experiments can be reached during routine data collection at undulator beamlines of third generation synchrotron sources. Conclusions: X-rays can leave a 'fingerprint' on structures, even at cryogenic temperatures. Serious non-isomorphism can be introduced, thus hampering multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) and multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing methods. Specific structural changes can occur before the traditional measures of radiation damage have signalled it. Care must be taken when assigning structural significance to features that might easily be radiation-damage-induced changes. It is proposed that the electron-affinic disulphide bond traps electrons that migrate over the backbone of the protein, and that the sidechains of glutamic acid and aspartic acid donate electrons to nearby electron holes and become decarboxylated successively. The different disulphide bonds in each protein show a clear order of susceptibility, which might well relate to their intrinsic stability.},

@article{Weik2000,
abstract = {Radiation damage is an inherent problem in x-ray crystallography. It usually is presumed to be nonspecific and manifested as a gradual decay in the overall quality of data obtained for a given crystal as data collection proceeds. Based on third-generation synchrotron x-ray data, collected at cryogenic temperatures, we show for the enzymes Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase and hen egg white lysozyme that synchrotron radiation also can cause highly specific damage. Disulfide bridges break, and carboxyl groups of acidic residues lose their definition. Highly exposed carboxyls, and those in the active site of both enzymes, appear particularly susceptible. The catalytic triad residue, His-440, in acetylcholinesterase, also appears to be much more sensitive to radiation damage than other histidine residues. Our findings have direct practical implications for routine x-ray data collection at high-energy synchrotron sources. Furthermore, they provide a direct approach for studying the radiation chemistry of proteins and nucleic acids at a detailed, structural level and also may yield information concerning putative “weak links” in a given biological macromolecule, which may be of structural and functional significance.},

abstract = {The fluorescence emission of yellow fluorescent proteins (YFPs) has been shown to respond rapidly and reversibly to changes in the concentration of some small anions such as halides; this allows for the use of YFPs as genetically encodable Cl- sensors that may be targeted to specific organelles in living cells. Fluorescence is suppressed due to protonation of the chromophore upon anion binding, with a stronger level of interaction at low pH values. At pH 6.0, the apparent dissociation constant (K(app)) for Cl- is 32 mM for YFP and 22 mM for YFP-H148Q, whereas at pH 7.5, K(app) is 777 mM and 154 mM, respectively. In the cytosol, YFP-H148Q appears most promising as a halide sensor due to its high degree of sensitivity towards I- (K(app) = 23 mM at pH 7.5). To aid in the design of variants with improved levels of specificity and affinity for Cl-, we solved apo and I--bound crystal structures of YFP-H148Q to 2.1 {\AA} resolution. The halide-binding site is found near van der Waals contact with the chromophore imidazolinone oxygen atom, in a small buried cavity adjacent to Arg96, which provides electrostatic stabilization. The halide ion is hydrogen bonded to the phenol group of T203Y, consistent with a mutational analysis that indicates that T203Y is indispensible for tight binding. A series of conformational changes occurs in the amphiphilic site upon anion binding, which appear to be propagated to the $\beta$-bulge region around residue 148 on the protein surface. Anion binding raises the chromophore pK(a) values, since delocalization of the phenolate negative charge over the chromophore skeleton is suppressed. Extraction of microscopic binding constants for the linked equilibrium between anion and proton binding indicates that anion selectivity by YFP is related to hydration forces. Specific suggestions to improve Cl- binding to YFP-H148Q based on size and hydration energy are proposed. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {The x-ray exposure at which significant radiation damage occurs has been quantified for frozen crystals of bacteriorhodopsin. The maximum exposure to $\sim$11-keV x-rays that can be tolerated for high-resolution diffraction experiments is found to be $\sim$1010 photons/$\mu$m2, very close to the value predicted from limits that were measured earlier for electron diffraction exposures. Sample heating, which would further reduce the x-ray exposure that could be tolerated, is not expected to be significant unless the x-ray flux density is well above 109 photons/s-$\mu$m2. Crystals of bacteriorhodopsin that contain $\sim$1011 unit cells are found to be large enough to give $\sim$100 high-resolution diffraction patterns, each covering one degree of rotation. These measurements are used to develop simple rules of thumb for the minimum crystal size that can be used to record x-ray diffraction data from protein microcrystals. For work with very small microcrystals to be realized in practice, however, it is desirable that there be a significant reduction in the level of background scattering. Background reduction can readily be achieved by improved microcollimation of the x-ray beam, and additional gains can be realized by the use of helium rather than nitrogen in the cold gas stream that is used to keep the protein crystals frozen.},

abstract = {The nature of the dynamical coupling between a protein and its surrounding solvent is an important, yet open issue. Here we used temperature-dependent protein crystallography to study structural alterations that arise in the enzyme acetylcholinesterase upon X-ray irradiation at two temperatures: below and above the glass transition of the crystal solvent. A buried disulfide bond, a buried cysteine, and solvent exposed methionine residues show drastically increased radiation damage at 155 K, in comparison to 100 K. Additionally, the irradiation-induced unit cell volume increase is linear at 100 K, but not at 155 K, which is attributed to the increased solvent mobility at 155 K. Most importantly, we observed conformational changes in the catalytic triad at the active site at 155 K but not at 100 K. These changes lead to an inactive catalytic triad conformation and represent, therefore, the observation of radiation-inactivation of an enzyme at the atomic level. Our results show that at 155 K, the protein has acquired-at least locally-sufficient conformational flexibility to adapt to irradiation-induced alterations in the conformational energy landscape. The increased protein flexibility may be a direct consequence of the solvent glass transition, which expresses as dynamical changes in the enzyme's environment. Our results reveal the importance of protein and solvent dynamics in specific radiation damage to biological macromolecules, which in turn can serve as a tool to study protein flexibility and its relation to changes in a protein's environment.},

This design allows the performance of true counter-diffusion experiments. Crystals were obtained under the classical chemical conditions de{\textregistered}ned 50 y ago with NaCl as a crystallizing agent and acetate pH 4.5 as a buffer. Counter-diffusion crystallization allows a `physical' instead of chemical optimization of growth conditions: indeed, this method screens for the best supersaturation conditions in a single trial and yields crystals of very high quality. A complete diffraction data set was collected at atomic resolution from one of these crystals using synchrotron radiation at the DESY±EMBL beamlines. The overall R merge on intensities in the resolution range 31±0.94 A {\^{E}} was 5.2% and the data were 98.9% complete.

A mean standard uncertainty in the atomic positions of 0.024 A {\^{E}} was estimated from inversion of blocked least-squares matrices. 22 side chains show alternate conformations and the loop 59±75 adopts in the same crystal packing two conformations that were observed for either triclinic or tetragonal lysozyme in previous high-resolution studies.

In order to fully utilize synchrotron facilities now available for studying biological crystals, it is essential to understand the processes involved in radiation damage and beam heating so that, if possible, action can be taken to slow the rate of damage. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) has been applied to model the heating effects of X-rays on cryocooled protein crystals, and to compare the relative cooling efficiencies of nitrogen and helium. #},

abstract = {Yellow mutants of the green fluorescent protein (YFP) are crucial constituents of genetically encoded indicators of signal transduction and fusions to monitor protein-protein interactions. However, previous YFPs show excessive pH sensitivity, chloride interference, poor photostability, or poor expression at 37 °C. Protein evolution in Escherichia coli has produced a new YFP named Citrine, in which the mutation Q69M confers a much lower pK$\alpha$ (5.7) than for previous YFPs, indifference to chloride, twice the photostability of previous YFPs, and much better expression at 37 °C and in organelles. The halide resistance is explained by a 2.2-{\AA} x-ray crystal structure of Citrine, showing that the methionine side chain fills what was once a large halide-binding cavity adjacent to the chromophore. Insertion of calmodulin within Citrine or fusion of cyan fluorescent protein, calmodulin, a calmodulin-binding peptide and Citrine has generated improved calcium indicators. These chimeras can be targeted to multiple cellular locations and have permitted the first single-cell imaging of free [Ca2+] in the Golgi. Citrine is superior to all previous YFPs except when pH or halide sensitivity is desired and is particularly advantageous within genetically encoded fluorescent indicators of physiological signals.},

abstract = {Polydocanol has a wide range of medical applications, especially in sclerotherapy of many diseases such as gastro-intestinal antiplastia, oesophageal haemangioma etc. It is of interest to study the mode of binding of this medically important detergent and its subsequent action on proteins. Here, three crystal structures of serine protease trypsin are reported in the presence of varying concentrations of polydocanol in order to elucidate its mode of binding and interactions with proteins. Polydocanol binds to the protein with its hydrophilic head rather than the hydrophobic tail as is the case with other detergents such as SDS and MEGA-8. This hydrophilic binding mode results in the binding sites of polydocanol being distributed on the surface of the enzyme. There are at least 11 binding sites for polydocanol in trypsin. Polydocanol forms part of the large-scale water networks which connect distant regions of the enzyme, thereby stabilizing it. The hydrophilic binding of polydocanol also results in cross-linked pairs of trypsin molecules.},

The data set collected at the most intense beamline (ID14-EH4) shows increased structural radiation damage in terms of lower occupancies for cysteine residues, more breakage in the six disul{\textregistered}de bonds and more alternate conformations.

abstract = {The use of third-generation synchrotron sources has led to renewed interest in the effect that ionizing radiation has on crystalline biological materials. Simple criteria have been sought to study the effects systematically. The unit-cell volume of protein crystals shows a linear increase with absorbed dose and has therefore been proposed to be such a measure. This paper demonstrates that the increase is sample dependent, and thus it might not be a useful indicator when comparing different samples. For individual samples, however, the increase can be used to quantify ambient temperature and dose-rate effects. In this study, highly absorbing cubic crystals of holoferritin have been used to accurately determine how cell volume changes with absorbed dose. The experiments show that, for this protein, a dose-rate effect exists and that trapped radicals can be mobilized at ca 180 K.},

abstract = {We designed a green fluorescent protein mutant (BFPms1) that preferentially binds Zn(II) (enhancing fluorescence intensity) and Cu(II) (quenching fluorescence) directly to a chromophore ligand that resembles a dipyrrole unit of a porphyrin. Crystallographic structure determination of apo, Zn(II)-bound, and Cu(II)-bound BFPms1 to better than 1.5 {\AA} resolution allowed us to refine metal centers without geometric restraints, to calculate experimental standard uncertainty errors for bond lengths and angles, and to model thermal displacement parameters anisotropically. The BFPms1 Zn(II) site (KD = 50 $\mu$M) displays distorted trigonal bipyrimidal geometry, with Zn(II) binding to Glu222, to a water molecule, and tridentate to the chromophore ligand. In contrast, the BFPms1 Cu(II) site (KD = 24 $\mu$M) exhibits square planar geometry similar to metalated porphyrins, with Cu(II) binding to the chromophore chelate and Glu222. The apo structure reveals a large electropositive region near the designed metal insertion channel, suggesting a basis for the measured metal cation binding kinetics. The preorganized tridentate ligand is accommodated in both coordination geometries by a 0.4 {\AA} difference between the Zn and Cu positions and by distinct rearrangements of Glu222. The highly accurate metal ligand bond lengths reveal different protonation states for the same oxygen bound to Zn vs Cu, with implications for the observed metal ion specificity. Crystallographic anisotropic thermal factor analysis validates metal ion rigidification of the chromophore in enhancement of fluorescence intensity upon Zn(II) binding. Thus, our high-resolution structures reveal how structure-based design has effectively linked selective metal binding to changes in fluorescent properties. Furthermore, this protein Zn(II) biosensor provides a prototype suitable for further optimization by directed evolution to generate metalloprotein variants with desirable physical or biochemical properties.

abstract = {Bacteriorhodopsin, the sole membrane protein of the purple membrane of Halobacterium salinarum, functions as a light-driven proton pump. A 3-D crystal of bacteriorhodopsin, which was prepared by the membrane fusion method, was used to investigate structural changes in the primary photoreaction. It was observed that when a frozen crystal was exposed to a low flux of X-ray radiation (5 × 1014 photons mm-2), nearly half of the protein was converted into an orange species, exhibiting absorption peaks at 450 nm, 478 nm and 510 nm. The remainder retained the normal photochemical activity until Asp85 in the active site was decarboxlyated by a higher flux of X-ray radiation (1016 photons mm-2). The procedure of diffraction measurement was improved so as to minimize the effects of the radiation damage and determine the true structural change associated with the primary photoreaction. Our structural model of the K intermediate indicates that the Schiff base linkage and the adjacent bonds in the polyene chain of retinal are largely twisted so that the Schiff base nitrogen atom still interacts with a water molecule located near Asp85. With respect to the other part of the protein, no appreciable displacement is induced in the primary photoreaction. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Yellow emission variants of green fluorescent protein (GFP) have been found useful in a variety of applications in biological systems due to their red-shifted emission spectrum and sensitivity to environmental parameters, such as pH and ionic strength. However, slow maturation properties and new requirements for more intense fluorescence necessitated further mutagenesis studies of these proteins. Venus, a new variant with improved maturation and brightness, as well as reduced environmental dependence, was recently developed by introducing five mutations into the well characterized variant, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP). In this paper, we present the crystal structure of Venus at 2.2 {\AA} resolution, which enabled us to correlate its novel features with these mutation points. The rearrangement of several side chains near the chromophore, initiated by the F46L mutation, was found to improve maturation at 37 °C by removing steric and energetic constraints, which may hinder folding of the polypeptide chain, and by accelerating the oxidation of the C$\alpha$-C$\beta$ bond of Tyr66 during chromophore formation. M153T, V163A, and S175G were also found to improve the rate of maturation by creating regions of greater flexibility. F64L induced large conformational changes in the molecule, leading to the removal of halide sensitivity by preventing ion access to the binding site.},

abstract = {Wild type green fluorescent protein (GFP) from Aequorea victoria absorbs predominantly at 398 nm. Illumination with UV (254 nm) or visible (390 nm) light transforms this state (GFP398) into one absorbing at 483 nm (GFP483). Here we show that this photoconversion of GFP is a one-photon process that is paralleled by decarboxylation of Glu 222. We propose a mechanism in which decarboxylation is due to electron transfer between the $\gamma$-carboxylate of Glu 222 and the p-hydroxybenzylidene-imidazolidinone chromophore of GFP, followed by reverse transfer of an electron and a proton to the remaining carbon side chain atom of Glu 222. Oxidative decarboxylation of a $\gamma$-carboxylate represents a new type of posttranslational modification that may also occur in enzymes with high-potential reaction intermediates. {\textcopyright} 2002 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Novel dual emission, pH-sensitive variants of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) have been constructed and are suitable for ratiometric emission measurements in vivo. This new class of GFPs, termed deGPFs, results from substitution of wild-type residue 65 with threonine and residues 148 and/or 203 with cysteine. deGFPs display pKa values ranging from 6.8 to 8.0 and emission that switches from a green form ($\lambda$max∼515 nm) to a blue form ($\lambda$max∼460 nm) with acidifying pH. In this report we analyze in most detail the deGFP1 variant (S65T/H148G/T203C, pKa ∼8.0) and the deGFP4 variant (S65T/C48S/ H148C/T203C, pKa∼7.3). In the following paper [McAnaney, T. B., Park, E. S., Hanson, G. T., Remington, S. J., and Boxer, S. G. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 15489-15494], data obtained by ultrafast fluorescence upconversion spectroscopy can be described by a kinetic model that includes an excited-state proton- transfer pathway at high pH but not at low pH. Crystal structure analyses of deGFP1 at high-pH and low-pH conformations were performed to elucidate the basis for the dual emission characteristics. At low pH the structure does not contain a hydrogen bond network that would support rapid transfer of a proton from the excited state of the neutral chromophore to a suitable acceptor; hence blue emission is observed. At high pH, backbone rearrangements induced by changes in the associated hydrogen bond network permit excited-state proton transfer from the excited state of the neutral chromophore to the bulk solvent via Ser147 and bound water molecules, resulting in green emission from the anionic chromophore. Comparative analysis suggests that the basis for dual emission is elimination of the wild-type proton-transfer network by the S65T substitution, a general reduction in hydrogen-bonding opportunities, and a concomitant increase in the hydrophobic nature of the chromophore environment resulting from the cysteine substitutions. We evaluated the suitability of the deGFP4 variant for intracellular pH measurements in mammalian cells by transient expression in PS120 fibroblasts. The responses of deGFP4 and a commercially available pH-sensitive dye, SNARF-1, to changes in pH were compared in the same cells. Results show that the dynamic range of the emission ratio change is comparable between the two pH sensors over the range examined. Two-photon excitation was found to elicit a better deGFP4 fluorescent signal above cellular autofluorescence when compared to conventional confocal microscopy. Given their favorable optical characteristics, suitable pKa's for the physiological pH range, and suitability for ratiometric measurements, dual emission GFPs should make excellent probes for studying pH in vivo.},

In this paper, disulfide bond lengths in irradiated crystals of the enzyme Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase are examined based on quantum simulations and on experimental data published previously. The experimental data suggest that one disulfide bond elongates by 0.7 \AA upon X-ray irradiation as seen in a series of nine data sets collected on a single crystal. Simulation of the same bond suggests elongation by a similar value if a disulfide-radical anion is formed by trapping an electron. The absorption spectrum of a crystal irradiated under similar conditions shows a peak at 400 nm, which in aqueous solution has been attributed to disulfide radicals. The results suggest that the formation of disulfide radicals in protein crystals owing to X-ray irradiation can be observed experimentally, both by structural means and by absorption spectroscopy.},

Many parameters can be changed in these experiments, such as temperature, pH, and ionic strength, but perhaps the most important variable has been ignored, namely the protein. The crystallization properties of a protein vary greatly: some crystallize readily, whereas others have proven extremely difficult or even impossible to obtain in a crystalline state.

Here we discover mutations that substantially slow the rate but not the yield of this posttranslational modification, determine structures of the trapped precyclization intermediate and oxidized postcyclization states, and identify unanticipated features critical to chromophore maturation. The protein architecture contains a dramatic ≈80° bend in the central helix, which focuses distortions at G67 to promote ring formation from amino acids S65, Y66, and G67. Significantly, these distortions eliminate potential helical hydrogen bonds that would otherwise have to be broken at an energetic cost during peptide cyclization and force the G67 nitrogen and S65 carbonyl oxygen atoms within van der Waals contact in preparation for covalent bond formation. Further, we determine that under aerobic, but not anaerobic, conditions the Gly-Gly-Gly chromophore sequence cyclizes and incorporates an oxygen atom. These results lead directly to a conjugation-trapping mechanism, in which a thermodynamically unfavorable cyclization reaction is coupled to an electronic conjugation trapping step, to drive chromophore maturation. Moreover, we propose primarily electrostatic roles for the R96 and E222 side chains in chromophore formation and suggest that the T62 carbonyl oxygen is the base that initiates the dehydration reaction. Our molecular mechanism provides the basis for understanding and eventually controlling chromophore creation.},

What is the 'phase' in crystallography? What is 'the problem'? How can we overcome the problem? The paper will emphasize that the phase values can only be discovered through some prior knowledge of the structure. The paper will canter through direct methods, isomorphous replacement, anomalous scattering and molecular replacement.

abstract = {Recent efforts to collect and mine crystallization data from structural genomics (SG) consortia have led to the identification of minimal screens and novel screening strategies that can be used to streamline the crystallization process. Two groups, the Joint Center for Structural Genomics and the University of Toronto, carried out large-scale crystallization trials on different sets of bacterial targets (539, JCSG and 755, Toronto), using different sample processing and crystallization methods, and then analyzed their results to identify the smallest subset of conditions that would have crystallized the maximum number of protein targets. The JCSG Core Screen contains 67 conditions (from 480) while the Toronto Minimal Screen contains 6 (from 48). While the exact conditions included in the two screens do not overlap, the major precipitants of the conditions are similar and thus both screens can be used to determine if a protein has a natural propensity to crystallize. In addition, studies from other groups including the University of Queensland, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis SG group, the Southeast Collaboratory for SG, and the York Structural Biology Laboratory indicate that alternative crystallization strategies may be more successful at identifying initial crystallization conditions than typical sparse matrix screens. These minimal screens and alternative screening strategies are already being used to optimize the crystallization processes within large SG efforts. The differences between these results, however, demonstrate that additional studies which examine the influence of protein biophysical properties and sample preparation methods on crystal formation must also be carried out before more robust screens can be identified. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In many crystallization screens sufficiently high levels of saturation are never reached to allow this critical nucleation event to occur. There are at least two possibilities to change this situation. The first is to increase the concentration of the protein and precipitating agent during the experiment to levels where spontaneous nucleation will occur. The second is to influence the nucleation event so that crystals can form at lower concentrations. The use of a modified microbatch method has made the first strategy possible and the use of heterogeneous seeding can be used to influence the second.},

abstract = {The structure and function of Bowman-Birk inhibitors (BBIs) from dicotyledonous plants such as soybean have been studied extensively. In contrast, relatively little is known about the BBIs from monocotyledonous plants such as barley, which differ from dicot BBIs in size and tertiary structure. The BBI from barley seeds (BBBI) consists of 125 amino acid residues with two separate inhibitory loops. Previously we determined the high-resolution structure of a 16 kDa BBBI in the free state. The BBBI folds into two compact domains (N and C domain) with tertiary structures that are similar to that of the 8 kDa BBI from dicots. Here we report the structure of a 1: 2 complex between BBBI and porcine pancreatic trypsin (PPT) at 2.2 {\AA} resolution. This structure confirms that several regions, including the inhibitory loops in the free BBBI structure, show exceptionally low temperature factors and a distorted conformation due to crystalline packing in the lattice. Extensive analysis of the interaction between BBBI and trypsin, and comparison with other known canonical inhibitor-protease complexes, reveals that the mode of interaction between BBBI and PPT is similar to that of known serine protease inhibitors, as expected; however, several unique features are also identified in the primary binding sites near the inhibitory loops as well as in additional binding sites. The carboxy-terminal tail of the inhibitor extends into the interface between the two trypsin molecules and interacts with both of them simultaneously. The longest distance between the two P1 residues (Arg17 and Arg76) in the complex structure is approximately 34 {\AA}, which is shorter than in the free inhibitor, but it is still possible for BBBI to bind and inhibit two trypsin molecules simultaneously and independently. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The classifier uses edge detection followed by dynamic-programming curve tracking to determine the drop boundary; this technique optimizes a scoring function that incorporates roundness, smoothness and gradient intensity. The classifier focuses on the most promising region in the drop and computes a number of statistical features, including some derived from the Hough transform and from curve tracking. The five classes of images are `Empty', `Clear', `Precipitate', `Microcrystal Hit' and `Crystal'. On test data, the classifier gives about 12% false negatives (true crystals called `Empty', `Clear' or `Precipitate') and about 14% false positives (true clears or precipitates called `Crystal' or `Microcrystal Hit').},

abstract = {The expanded genetic code in combination with site-directed mutagenesis was used to probe spectroscopic and structural roles of tryptophan (Trp) residues in Aequorea victoria green fluorescent proteins (avGFPs). Nine different halogen-, chalcogen-, and methyl-containing Trp isosteric analogues and surrogates were incorporated into avGFPs containing indole moieties in, and outside of, the chromophore, by the use of the selective pressure incorporation method. Such isosteric replacements introduced minimal local geometry changes in indole moieties, often to the level of single atomic exchange ('atomic mutation') and do not affect three-dimensional structures of avGFPs but induce changes in spectral properties. Our approach offers a new platform to re-evaluate issues like resonance transfer, mechanisms of chromophore formation and maturation, as well as the importance of local geometry and weak sulphur-aromatic interactions for avGFP spectral properties and structural stability. The library of novel tailor-made avGFP mutants and variants generated in this work has demonstrated not only the potentials of the expanded genetic code to study spectroscopic functions, but also a new approach to generate tailor-made proteins with interesting and useful spectral properties.},

abstract = {Complete and highly redundant data sets were collected at nine different wavelengths between 0.80 and 2.65 {\AA} on a xenon derivative of porcine pancreatic elastase in both air and helium atmospheres. The magnitude of the anomalous signal, as assessed by the xenon-peak height in the anomalous difference Patterson synthesis, is affected by the wavelength of data collection as well as by the scaling model used. For data collected at wavelengths longer than 1.7 {\AA}, the use of a three-dimensional scaling protocol is essential in order to obtain the highest possible anomalous signal. Based on the scaling protocols currently available, the optimal wavelength range for data collection appears to be between 2.1 and 2.4 {\AA}. Beyond that, any further increase in signal will be compensated for or even superseded by a concomitant increase in noise, which cannot be fully corrected for. Data collection in a helium atmosphere yields higher I/$\sigma$(I) values, but not significantly better anomalous differences, than data collection in air. {\textcopyright} 2004 International Union of Crystallography.},

abstract = {Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins are the most potent toxins to humans and cause paralysis by blocking neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic nerve terminals. The toxicity involves four steps, viz., binding to neuronal cells, internalization, translocation, and catalytic activity. While the catalytic activity is a zinc endopeptidase activity on the SNARE complex proteins, the translocation is believed to be a pH-dependent process allowing the translocation domain to change its conformation to penetrate the endosomal membrane. Here, we report the crystal structures of botulinum neurotoxin type B at various pHs and of an apo form of the neurotoxin, and discuss the role of metal ions and the effect of pH variation in the biological activity. Except for the perturbation of a few side chains, the conformation of the catalytic domain is unchanged in the zinc-depleted apotoxin, suggesting that zinc's role is catalytic. We have also identified two calcium ions in the molecule and present biochemical evidence to show that they play a role in the translocation of the light chain through the membrane.},

The resulting pAE plasmid combined the advantages of both vectors: small size (pRSET), expression of a short 6XHis tag at N-terminus (pET3-His) and a high copy number of plasmid (pRSET). The small size of the vector (2.8 kb) and the high copy number/cell (200-250 copies) facilitate the subcloning and sequencing procedures when compared to the pET system (pET3-His, 4.6 kb and 40-50 copies) and also result in high level expression of recombinant proteins (20 mg purified protein/liter of culture). In addition, the vector pAE enables the expression of a fusion protein with a minimal amino-terminal hexa-histidine affinity tag (a tag of 9 amino acids using XhoI restriction enzyme for the 5'cloning site) as in the case of pET3-His plasmid and in contrast to proteins expressed by pRSET plasmids (a tag of 36 amino acids using BamHI restriction enzyme for the 5'cloning site). Thus, although proteins expressed by pRSET plasmids also have a hexa-histidine tag, the fusion peptide is much longer and may represent a problem for some recombinant proteins.},

Here, we report a case study of the complexity of amino acid interactions in a localized region within the core of the GFP, a particularly stable and tightly packed molecule. Mutations at three sites within the chromophore-binding pocket display an overlapping pattern of conformational change and are thermodynamically coupled, seemingly consistent with the dense network model. However, crystallographic and energetic analyses of coupling between mutations paint a different picture; pairs of mutations couple through independent “hotspots” in the region of structural overlap. The data indicate that, even in highly stable proteins, the core contains sufficient plasticity in packing to uncouple high-order energetic interactions of residues, a property that is likely general in proteins.},

abstract = {Practical classes on protein expression and purification were given to undergraduate biology students enrolled in the elective course "Introduction to Genetic Engineering." The heterologous expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP)* of Aequorea victoria is an interesting system for didactic purposes because it can be viewed easily during experiments. The students were provided with basic information about the molecular features and applications of the GFP in molecular biology, the available heterologous expression systems, and the theoretical and experimental details of GFP expression in Escherichia coli and its purification. E. coli BL21-competent cells were transformed with the pET28a expression vector containing the GFP gene fused to a histidine (His) tag. During the induction of a transformed clone by isopropylthiogalactoside, a time course for GFP expression was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the expression was also visualized by the increasing green fluorescence of the bacterial culture. After cellular disruption, protein purification was illustrated by affinity chromatography of the His-tagged protein in a nickel column. Eluted fractions containing imidazole in increasing concentrations were analyzed visually and also by SDS-PAGE, demonstrating the role of imidazole in protein recovery by competition with nonspecific proteins and the His-tagged protein. The results obtained and the experimental factors involved in protein expression, solubilization, and folding were discussed following the laboratory experiments. These practical classes allowed several current approaches to molecular biology to be demonstrated rapidly and helped underscore some of the topics taught during the course. The elective course "Introduction to Genetic Engineer-ing" was given to third-and fourth-year biology students at the Federal University of S{\~{a}} o Carlos (S{\~{a}} o Carlos-SP, Bra-zil). Laboratory experiments were carried out at the end of the course to illustrate protein expression in Escherichia coli cells and purification by affinity chromatography. The practical classes lasted 3 days during which the eight students were divided into two groups for the laboratory experiments. Students were asked to answer a questionnaire assessing the overall quality of the course and their attendance and participation in class. Protein expression followed by protein purification are current tools extensively used in molecular biology for the large-scale preparation of pure proteins for many purposes , such as crystallization, kinetic studies, or the production of antibodies. To illustrate these molecular tools, our didactic approach involved the use of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), 1 a naturally occurring fluorescent protein found in the jellyfish Aequorea victoria. GFP has already been used as an educational tool for undergraduate and graduate students, particularly to demonstrate protein purification [1]. The experimental approach reported here focuses not only on protein purification but also on protein expression from the lac promoter at basal and induced levels. To this end, we have previously cloned the GFP gene in pET28a, a vector that follows the two-step mechanism of expression under isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) induction. This mechanism of expression is often used for producing proteins in E. coli because of the selective high-level expression of the cloned genes [2]. Our students were provided with information about the theoretical and practical aspects involved in the experiments, as described below. The GFP is a 238-aa protein containing the trimer serine-65, tyrosine-66, and glycine-67, which forms a fluorescent chromophore after cyclization and oxidation reactions.

abstract = {Current methods for determining ambient redox potential in cells are labor-intensive and generally require destruction of tissue. This precludes single cell or real time studies of changes in redox poise that result from metabolic processes or environmental influences. By substitution of surface-exposed residues on the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) with cysteines in appropriate positions to form disulfide bonds, reduction-oxidation-sensitive GFPs (roGFPs) have been created. roGFPs have two fluorescence excitation maxima at about 400 and 490 nm and display rapid and reversible ratiometric changes in fluorescence in response to changes in ambient redox potential in vitro and in vivo. Crystal structure analyses of reduced and oxidized crystals of roGFP2 at 2.0- and 1.9-{\AA} resolution, respectively, reveal in the oxidized state a highly strained disulfide and localized main chain structural changes that presumably account for the state-dependent spectral changes. roGFP1 has been targeted to the mitochondria in HeLa cells. Fluorometric measurements on these cells using a fluorescence microscope or in cell suspension using a fluorometer reveal that the roGFP1 probe is in dynamic equilibrium with the mitochondrial redox status and responds to membrane-permeable reductants and oxidants. The roGFP1 probe reports that the matrix space in HeLa cell mitochondria is highly reducing, with a midpoint potential near -360 mV (assuming mitochondrial pH ∼8.0 at 37 °C). In other work (C. T. Dooley, T. M. Dore, G. Hanson, W. C. Jackson, S. J. Remington, and R. Y. Tsien, submitted for publication), it is shown that the cytosol of HeLa cells is also unusually reducing but somewhat less so than the mitochondrial matrix.},

abstract = {The crystal structure of a colorless variant of green fluorescent protein (GFP) containing the Y66L substitution has been determined to 1.5 {\AA}. Crystallographic evidence is presented for the formation of a trapped intermediate on the pathway of chromophore maturation, where the peptide backbone of residues 65-67 has condensed to form a five-membered heterocyclic ring. The hydroxyl leaving group remains attached to the ring as confirmed by high-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry. The $\alpha$-carbon of residue 66 exhibits trigonal planar geometry, consistent with ring oxidation by molecular oxygen. Side chain positions of surrounding residues are not perturbed, in contrast to structural results obtained for the GFPsol-S65G/Y66G variant [Barondeau, D. P., Putnam, C. D., Kassmann, C. J., Tainer, J. A., and Getzoff, E. D. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 100, 12111-12116]. The data are in accord with a reaction pathway in which dehydration is the last of three chemical steps in GFP chromophore formation. A novel mechanism for chromophore biosynthesis is proposed: when the protein folds, the backbone condenses to form a cyclopentyl tetrahedral intermediate. In the second step, the ring is oxidized by molecular oxygen. In the third and final step, elimination of the hydroxyl leaving group as water is coupled to a proton transfer reaction that may proceed via hydrogen-bonded solvent molecules. Replacement of the aromatic Tyr66 with an aliphatic residue appears to have a profound effect on the efficiency of ring dehydration. The proposed mechanism has important implications for understanding the factors that limit the maturation rate of GFP.},

abstract = {Crystallization of proteins is a nontrivial task, and despite the substantial efforts in robotic automation, crystallization screening is still largely based on trial-and-error sampling of a limited subset of suitable reagents and experimental parameters. Funding of high throughput crystallography pilot projects through the NIH Protein Structure Initiative provides the opportunity to collect crystallization data in a comprehensive and statistically valid form. Data mining and machine learning algorithms thus have the potential to deliver predictive models for protein crystallization. However, the underlying complex physical reality of crystallization, combined with a generally ill-defined and sparsely populated sampling space, and inconsistent scoring and annotation make the development of predictive models non-trivial. We discuss the conceptual problems, and review strengths and limitations of current approaches towards crystallization prediction, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive and valid sampling protocols. In view of limited overlap in techniques and sampling parameters between the publicly funded high throughput crystallography initiatives, exchange of information and standardization should be encouraged, aiming to effectively integrate data mining and machine learning efforts into a comprehensive predictive framework for protein crystallization. Similar experimental design and knowledge discovery strategies should be applied to valid analysis and prediction of protein expression, solubilization, and purification, as well as crystal handling and cryo-protection. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Halle2004,
abstract = {To minimize radiation damage, crystal structures of biological macromolecules are usually determined after rapid cooling to cryogenic temperatures, some 150–200 K below the normal physiological range. The biological relevance of such structures relies on the assumption that flash-cooling is sufficiently fast to kinetically trap the macromolecule and associated solvent in a room-temperature equilibrium state. To test this assumption, we use a two-state model to calculate the structural changes expected during rapid cooling of a typical protein crystal. The analysis indicates that many degrees of freedom in a flash-cooled protein crystal are quenched at temperatures near 200 K, where local conformational and association equilibria may be strongly shifted toward low-enthalpy states. Such cryoartifacts should be most important for strongly solvent-coupled processes, such as hydration of nonpolar cavities and surface regions, conformational switching of solvent-exposed side chains, and weak ligand binding. The dynamic quenching that emerges from the model considered here can also rationalize the glass transition associated with the atomic fluctuations in the protein.},

abstract = {An understanding of the physiological and toxicological properties of borate and the utilization of boronic acids in drug development require a basic understanding of borate-enzyme chemistry. We report here the extension of our recent NMR studies indicating the formation of a ternary borate-alcohol-trypsin complex. Crystallographic and solution state NMR studies of porcine trypsin were performed in the presence of borate and either of three alcohols designed to bind to the S1 affinity subsite: 4-aminobutanol, guanidine-3-propanol, and 4-hydroxymethylbenzamidine. Quaternary complexes of trypsin, borate, S1-binding alcohol, and ethylene glycol (a cryoprotectant), as well as a ternary trypsin, borate, and ethylene glycol complex have been observed in the crystalline state. Borate forms ester bonds to Ser195, ethylene glycol (two bonds), and the S1-binding alcohol (if present). Spectra from 1H and 11B NMR studies confirm that these complexes also exist in solution and also provide evidence for the formation of ternary trypsin, borate, and S1-subsite alcohol complexes which are not observed in the crystals using our experimental protocols. Analysis of eight crystal structures indicates that formation of an active site borate complex is in all cases accompanied by a significant (∼4%) increase in the b-axis dimension of the unit cell. Presumably, our inability to observe the ternary complexes in the crystalline state arises from the lower stability of these complexes and consequent inability to overcome the constraints imposed by the lattice contacts. A mechanism for the coupling of the lattice contacts with the active site that involves a conformational rearrangement of Gln192 is suggested. The structures presented here represent the first crystallographic demonstration of covalent binding of an enzyme by borate.},

abstract = {The light-induced isomerization of a double bond is the key event that allows the conversion of light energy into a structural change in photoactive proteins for many light-mediated biological processes, such as vision, photosynthesis, photomorphogenesis, and photo movement. Cofactors such as retinals, linear tetrapyrroles, and 4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid have been selected by nature that provide the essential double bond to transduce the light signal into a conformational change and eventually, a physiological response. Here we report the first events after light excitation of the latter chromophore, containing a single ethylene double bond, in a low temperature crystallographic study of the photoactive yellow protein. We measured experimental phases to overcome possible model bias, corrected for minimized radiation damage, and measured absorption spectra of crystals to analyze the photoproducts formed. The data show a mechanism for the light activation of photoactive yellow protein, where the energy to drive the remainder of the conformational changes is stored in a slightly strained but fully cis-chromophore configuration. In addition, our data indicate a role for backbone rearrangements during the very early structural events.},

abstract = {In the accurate estimation of small signals, redundancy of observations is often seen as an essential tool for the experimenter. This is particularly true during macromolecular structure determination by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD), where the exploitable signal can be less than a few percent. At the most intense undulator synchrotron beamlines, the effect of radiation damage can be such that all usable signal is obscured. Here the magnitude of this effect in experiments performed at the Se K-edge is quantified. Six successive data sets were collected on the same crystal, interspersed with two exposures to the X-ray beam during which data were not collected. It is shown that the very first data set has excellent phasing statistics, whereas these statistics degrade for the later data sets. Merging several data sets into one, highly redundant, data set only gave moderate improvements as a result of the presence of radiation damage. Part of the damage could be corrected for using a linear interpolation scheme. Interpolation of the data to a low-dose as well as to a high-dose data set allowed us to combine the SAD method with the radiation-damage induced phasing (RIP) technique, which further improved the experimental phases, especially after density modification. Some recommendations are given on how to mitigate the effect of radiation damage during structure determination. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Great Britain - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) undergoes a remarkable post-translational modification to create a chromophore out of its component amino acids S65, Y66, and G67. Here, we describe mutational experiments in GFP designed to convert this chromophore into a 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO) moiety similar to the post-translational active-site electrophile of histidine ammonia lyase (HAL). Crystallographic structures of GFP variant S65A Y66S (GFPhal) and of four additional related site-directed mutants reveal an aromatic MIO moiety and mechanistic details of GFP chromophore formation and MIO biosynthesis. Specifically, the GFP scaffold promotes backbone cyclization by (1) favoring nucleophilic attack by close proximity alignment of the G67 amide lone pair with the $\pi$* orbital of the residue 65 carbonyl and (2) removing enthalpic barriers by eliminating inhibitory main-chain hydrogen bonds in the precursor state. GFP R96 appears to induce structural rearrangements important in aligning the molecular orbitals for ring cyclization, favor G67 nitrogen deprotonation through electrostatic interactions with the Y66 carbonyl, and stabilize the reduced enolate intermediate. Our structures and analysis also highlight negative design features of the wild-type GFP architecture, which favor chromophore formation by destabilizing alternative conformations of the chromophore tripeptide. By providing a molecular basis for understanding and controlling the driving force and protein chemistry of chromophore creation, this research has implications for expansion of the genetic code through engineering of modified amino acids.},

abstract = {Aequoria victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a revolutionary molecular biology tool because of its spontaneous peptide backbone cyclization and chromophore formation from residues Ser65, Tyr66, and Gly67. Here we use structure-based design, comprehensive targeted mutagenesis, and high-resolution crystallography to probe the significant functional role of conserved Arg96 (R96) in chromophore maturation. The R96M GFP variant, in which the R96M side chain is similar in volume but lacks the R96 positive charge, exhibits dramatically slower chromophore maturation kinetics (from hours to months). Comparison of the precyclized conformation of the chromophore-forming residues with the mature R96M chromophore reveals a similar Y66 conformer, contrary to the large Y66 conformational change previously defined in the slowly maturing R96A variant [Barondeau, D. P., Putnam, C. D., Kassmann, C. J., Tainer, J. A., and Getzoff, E. D. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci. U.S.A. 100, 12111-12116]. Comprehensive R96 mutagenesis and fluorescent colony screening indicate that only the R96K substitution restores wild-type maturation kinetics. Further, we show that the slowly maturing R96A variant can be complemented with a Q183R second-site mutation designed to restore the missing R96 positive charge and rapid fluorophore biosynthesis. Moreover, comparative structural analysis of R96M, R96K, R96A/Q183R, and wild-type GFP reveals the importance of the presence of positive charge, rather than its exact position. Together, these structural, mutational, and biochemical results establish a pivotal role for the R96 positive charge in accelerating the GFP post-translational modification, with implications for peptide backbone cyclization in GFP, its homologues, and related biological systems. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Chemical Society.},

An improved purification procedure that delivers highly pure protein (>95% homogeneity) in high yields (>70% of the initial fluorescent protein content) has been developed. The purification procedure requires only two steps: the cell lysate is heated to 60°C for 4 min in ammonium sulfate and triethylamine, followed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography using isopropanol during the elution phase. The resulting pure product exhibits the same fluorescence profile as the crude sample. This procedure has been demonstrated on three commercial variants of GFP from Aequorea victoria, enhanced green, enhanced yellow, and enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (Becton-Dickinson). The yield and purity of material are superior to other recently described methods. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Green fluorescent protein (GFP) is an unusually stable autofluorescent protein that is increasingly being exploited for many applications. In this report, we have used fluorescence spectroscopy to study the effect of pH on the denaturation of GFP with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), urea, and heat. Surprisingly, SDS (up to 0.5%) did not have any significant effect on the fluorescence of GFP at pH 7.5 or 8.5 buffers; however, at pH 6.5, the protein lost all fluorescence within 1 min of incubation. Similarly, incubation of GFP with 8 M urea at 50°C resulted in time dependent denaturation of GFP, but only in pH 6.5 buffer. At higher pH values (pH 7.5 and pH 8.5), the GFP was quite stable in 8 M urea at 50°C, showing only a slight decrease in fluores-cence. Heat denaturation of GFP was found to be pH dependent as well, with the denaturation being fastest at pH 6.5 as compared to pH 7.5 or pH 8.5. Like the denaturation studies, renaturation of heat-denatured GFP was most efficient at pH 8.5, followed by pH 7.5, and then pH 6.5. These results suggests that GFP undergoes a structural/stability shift between pH 6.5 and pH 7.5, with the GFP structure at pH 6.5 being very sensitive to denaturation by SDS, urea, and heat.},

abstract = {The common goal for structural genomic centers and consortiums is to decipher as quickly as possible the three-dimensional structures for a multitude of recombinant proteins derived from known genomic sequences. Since X-ray crystallography is the foremost method to acquire atomic resolution for macromolecules, the limiting step is obtaining protein crystals that can be useful of structure determination. High-throughput methods have been developed in recent years to clone, express, purify, crystallize and determine the three-dimensional structure of a protein gene product rapidly using automated devices, commercialized kits and consolidated protocols. However, the average number of protein structures obtained for most structural genomic groups has been very low compared to the total number of proteins purified. As more entire genomic sequences are obtained for different organisms from the three kingdoms of life, only the proteins that can be crystallized and whose structures can be obtained easily are studied. Consequently, an astonishing number of genomic proteins remain unexamined. In the era of high-throughput processes, traditional methods in molecular biology, protein chemistry and crystallization are eclipsed by automation and pipeline practices. The necessity for high-rate production of protein crystals and structures has prevented the usage of more intellectual strategies and creative approaches in experimental executions. Fundamental principles and personal experiences in protein chemistry and crystallization are minimally exploited only to obtain "low-hanging fruit" protein structures. We review the practical aspects of today's high-throughput manipulations and discuss the challenges in fast pace protein crystallization and tools for crystallography. Structural genomic pipelines can be improved with information gained from low-throughput tactics that may help us reach the higher-bearing fruits. Examples of recent developments in this area are reported from the efforts of the Southeast Collaboratory for Structural Genomics (SECSG). {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Designed synthetic heterochiral peptides, when added to porcine trypsin, resulted in reduction of enzyme activity. The crystal structure of a complex formed between porcine trypsin and a heterochiral hepta peptide Boc-Pro-DAsp-Aib-Leu-Aib-Leu-Ala-NHMe has been determined at 1.9 {\AA} resolution. The hepta peptide does not bind at the active site, but is located in the interstitial region, and interacts with the calcium-binding loop (residues 60–80). The bound peptide interacts with the active site residue Ser195 through an acetate ion, and with Lys 60 mediated by water molecules. The structure, when compared with the other trypsin-peptide complexes, suggests that the flexibility of surface loops, concerted movement of the loops towards the active site, and the interaction of the bound peptide with Lys 60, may be responsible for the reduction in enzyme activity. This study provides a structural evidence for the earlier biochemical observation regarding the role of surface loops in the catalysis of the enzyme. {\textcopyright} 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluoresces efficiently under blue excitation despite major electrostatic rearrangements resulting from photoionization of the chromophore and neutralization of Glu-222. A competing phototransformation process, which ionizes the chromophore and decarboxylates Glu-222, mimics the electrostatic and structural changes in the fluorescence photocycle. Structural and spectroscopic analysis of the cryogenically stabilized photoproduct at 100 K and a structurally annealed intermediate of the phototransformed protein at 170 K reveals distinct structural relaxations involving protein, chromophore, solvent, and photogenerated CO2. Strong structural changes of the 100 K photoproduct after decarboxylation appear exclusively within 15 {\AA} of the chromophore and include the electrostatically driven perturbations of Gln-69, Cys-70, and water molecules in an H-bonding network con-necting the chromophore. X-ray crystallography to 1.85 {\AA} resolution and static and picosecond time-resolved IR spectroscopy identify structural mechanisms common to phototransformation and to the fluorescence photocycle. In particular, the appearance of a 1697 cm-1 (+) difference band in both photocycle and phototransformation intermediates is a spectroscopic signature for the structural perturbation of Gln-69. This is taken as evidence for an electrostatically driven dynamic response that is common to both photoreaction pathways. The interactions between the chromophore and the perturbed residues and solvent are decreased or removed in the T203H single and T203H/Q69L double mutants, resulting in a strong reduction of the fluorescence quantum yield. This suggests that the electrostatic response to the transient formation of a buried charge in the wild type is important for the bright fluorescence. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {A crystallization screening process is presented that was developed for a small academic laboratory. Its underlying concept is to combine sparse-matrix screening with systematic screening in a minimum number of crystallization conditions. The sparse-matrix screen is the cherry-picked combination of conditions from the Joint Center for Structural Genomics (JCSG) extended using conditions from other screens. Its aim is to maximize the coverage of crystallization parameter space with no redundancy. The systematic screen, a pH-, anion- and cation-testing (PACT) screen, aims to decouple the components of each condition and to provide information about the protein, even in the absence of crystals, rather than cover a wide crystallization space. This screening strategy is combined with nanolitre-volume dispensing hardware and a small but practical experiment-tracking system. The screens have been tested both at the NKI and in other laboratories and it is concluded that they provide a useful minimal screening strategy. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Union of Crystallography - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {The study of temperature-dependent physical changes in flash-cooled macromolecular crystals is pertinent to cryocrystallography and related issues such as crystal annealing, X-ray radiation damage and kinetic crystallography. In this context, the unit-cell volume of flash-cooled trigonal and orthorhombic trypsin crystals has been monitored upon warming from 100 to 200 K and subsequent re-cooling to 100 K. Crystals of both forms were obtained under the same crystallization conditions, yet they differ in solvent content and channel size. An abrupt non-reversible unit-cell volume decrease is observed at 185 K in orthorhombic and at 195 K in trigonal crystals as the temperature is increased; this result is consistent with ultra-viscous solvent leaving the crystals. Concomitant appearance of ice rings in the diffraction patterns suggests that the transported solvent forms crystalline ice. These results demonstrate that solvent in flash-cooled protein crystals is liquid-like near its crystallization temperature, as has been proposed, yet controversially discussed, for the case of pure water. The use of mineral oil prevents the unit-cell volume decrease in trigonal but not in orthorhombic crystals. The observation of liquid-like solvent has implications in the development of annealing protocols and points a way to the rational design of temperature-controlled crystallographic studies that aim either at studying specific radiation damage or at trapping enzymatic intermediate states. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Great Britain - all rights reserved.},

The analysis of protease-inhibitor complexes helps in understanding the mechanism of action, as well as in designing inhibitors. Vasopressin, an anti-diuretic nonapeptide hormone, is found to be an effective inhibitor of trypsin, with a Ki value of 5 nM. The crystal structure of the trypsin-vasopressin complex revealed that vasopressin fulfils all the important interactions for an inhibitor, without any break in the scissile peptide bond. The cyclic nature due to a disulfide bridge between Cys1 and Cys6 of vasopressin provides structural rigidity to the peptide hormone. The trypsin-binding site is located at the C terminus, while the neurophysin-binding site is at the N terminus of vasopressin. This study will assist in designing new peptide inhibitors. This study suggests that vasopressin inhibition of trypsin may have unexplored biological implications. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The effects of these variables on the predicted absorbed dose, calculated using the program RADDOSE, are discussed and are illustrated with reference to the irradiation of a selenomethionine protein crystal of unknown structure. The results of RADDOSE can and will in the future be used to inform the data collection procedure as it sets a theoretical upper limit on the total exposure time at a certain X-ray source. However, as illustrated with an example for which the experimental data are compared with prediction, the actual lifetime of a crystal could become shorter in those cases where specific damage breaks down crucial crystal contacts. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Great Britain - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {Specific radiation damage can be used to solve macromolecular structures using the radiation-damage-induced phasing (RIP) method. The method has been investigated for six disulfide-containing test structures (elastase, insulin, lysozyme, ribonuclease A, trypsin and thaumatin) using data sets that were collected on a third-generation synchrotron undulator beamline with a highly attenuated beam. Each crystal was exposed to the unattenuated X-ray beam between the collection of a 'before' and an 'after' data set. The X-ray 'burn'-induced intensity differences ranged from 5 to 15%, depending on the protein investigated. X-ray-susceptible substructures were determined using the integrated direct and Patterson methods in SHELXD. The best substructures were found by downscaling the 'after' data set in SHELXC by a scale factor K, with optimal values ranging from 0.96 to 0.99. The initial substructures were improved through iteration with SHELXE by the addition of negatively occupied sites as well as a large number of relatively weak sites. The final substructures ranged from 40 to more than 300 sites, with strongest peaks as high as 57$\sigma$. All structures except one could be solved: it was not possible to find the initial substructure for ribonuclease A, however, SHELXE iteration starting with the known five most susceptible sites gave excellent maps. Downscaling proved to be necessary for the solution of elastase, lysozyme and thaumatin and reduced the number of SHELXE iterations in the other cases. The combination of downscaling and substructure iteration provides important benefits for the phasing of macromolecular structures using radiation damage. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Union of Crystallography - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {The mechanism of chromophore biosynthesis in green fluorescent protein (GFP) is triggered by a spontaneous main chain cyclization reaction of residues 65-67. Here, we demonstrate that the initially colorless Y66L variant, designed to trap chromophore precursor states, is oxidatively modified to generate yellow chromophores that absorb at 412 and 374 nm. High- and low-pH crystal structures determined to 2.0 and 1.5 {\AA} resolution, respectively, are consistent with $\pi$-orbital conjugation of a planar Leu66-derived adduct with the imidazolinone ring, which is ∼90 and 100% dehydrated, respectively. Time-, base-, and oxygen-dependent optical properties suggest that the yellow chromophores are generated from a 338 nm-absorbing intermediate, interpreted to be the Y66L analogue of the wild-type GFP chromophore. Generation of this species is catalyzed by a general base such as formate, and proceeds via a cyclization-oxidation-dehydration mechanism. The data suggest that a hydration-dehydration equilibrium exists in the cyclic form of the peptide, and that dehydration is favored upon extensive conjugation with the modified side chain. We conclude that the mechanism of GFP chromophore biosynthesis is not driven by the aromatic character of residue 66. In the low-pH X-ray structure, a highly unusual cross-link is observed between His148 and the oxidized Leu66 side chain, suggesting a conjugate addition reaction of the imidazole nitrogen to the highly electrophilic diene group of the yellow chromophore. The reactivity described here further expands the chemical diversity observed in the active site of GFP-like proteins, and may allow for covalent attachment of functional groups to the protein scaffold for catalytic purposes. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The majority of 3D structures of macromolecules are currently determined by macromolecular crystallography, which employs the diffraction of X-rays on single crystals. However, during diffraction experiments, the X-rays can damage the protein crystals by ionization processes, especially when powerful X-ray sources at synchrotron facilities are used. This process of radiation damage generates photo-electrons that can get trapped in protein moieties. The 3D structure derived from such experiments can differ remarkably from the structure of the native molecule. Recently, the crystal structures of different oxidation states of horseradish peroxidase and nickel-containing superoxide dismutase were determined using crystallographic redox titration performed during the exposure of the crystals to the incident X-ray beam. Previous crystallographic analyses have not shown the distinct structures of the active sites associated with the redox state of the structural features of these enzymes. These new studies show that, for protein moieties that are susceptible to radiation damage and prone to reduction by photo-electrons, care is required in both the design of the diffraction experiment and the analysis and interpretation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Radiation damage to cryocooled protein crystals during x-ray structure determination has become an inherent part of macromolecular diffraction data collection at third-generation synchrotrons. Generally, radiation damage is an undesirable component of the experiment and can result in erroneous structural detail in the final model. The characterization of radiation damage thus has become an important area for structural biologists. The calculated dose limit of 2 × 10 7 Gy for the diffracting power of cryocooled protein crystals to drop by half has been experimentally evaluated at a third-generation synchrotron source. Successive data sets were collected from four holoferritin and three apoferritin crystals. The absorbed dose for each crystal was calculated by using the program raddose after measurement of the incident photon flux and determination of the elemental crystal composition by micro-particle-induced x-ray emission. Degradation in diffraction quality and specific structural changes induced by synchrotron radiation then could be compared directly with absorbed dose for different dose/dose rate regimes: a 10% lifetime decrease for a 10-fold dose rate increase was observed. Remarkable agreement both between different crystals of the same type and between apoferritin and holoferritin was observed for the dose required to reduce the diffracted intensity by half ( D 1/2 ). From these measurements, a dose limit of D 1/2 = 4.3 (±0.3) ×10 7 Gy was obtained. However, by considering other data quality indicators, an intensity reduction to I ln2 = ln2 × I 0 , corresponding to an absorbed dose of 3.0 × 10 7 Gy, is recommended as an appropriate dose limit for typical macromolecular crystallography experiments.},

Compared to 'folding reporter' GFP, a folding-enhanced GFP containing the 'cycle-3' mutations and the 'enhanced GFP' mutations F64L and S65T, superfolder GFP shows improved tolerance of circular permutation, greater resistance to chemical denaturants and improved folding kinetics. The fluorescence of Escherichia coli cells expressing each of eighteen proteins from Pyrobaculum aerophilum as fusions with superfolder GFP was proportional to total protein expression. In contrast, fluorescence of folding reporter GFP fusion proteins was strongly correlated with the productive folding yield of the passenger protein.

Radiation damage per incident photon increases linearly with the absorption coefficient of the crystal, but damage per absorbed photon is the same for all heavy-atom concentrations. Similar damage per absorbed photon is observed for crystals of three proteins with different molecular sizes and solvent contents. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Union of Crystallography - all rights reserved.},

We assessed the impact of 200 chemicals on the propensity of 81 different proteins and viruses to crystallize. The experiments were comprised of 18 240 vapor diffusion trials. A salient feature of the experiments was that, aside from the inclusion of the reagent mixes, only two fundamental crystallization conditions were used, 30% PEG 3350, and 50% Tacsimate™ at pH 7. Overall, 65 proteins (85%) were crystallized. Most significant was that 35 of the 65 (54%) crystallized only in the presence of one or more reagent mixes, but not in control samples lacking any additives. Among the most promising types of reagent mixes were those composed of polyvalent, charged groups, such as di and tri carboxylic acids, diamino compounds, molecules bearing one or more sulfonyl or phosphate groups, and a broad range of common biochemicals, coenzymes, biological effectors, and ligands. We propose that an alternate approach to crystallizing proteins might be developed, which employs a limited set of fundamental crystallization conditions combined with a broad screen of potentially useful small molecule additives. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Protein crystallography laboratories are performing an increasing number of experiments to obtain crystals of good diffraction quality. Better automation has enabled researchers to prepare and run more experiments in a shorter time. However, the problem of identifying which experiments are successful remains difficult. In fact, most of this work is still performed manually by humans. Automating this task is therefore an important goal. As part of a project to develop a new and automated high-throughput capillary-based protein crystallography instrument, a new image-classification subsystem has been developed to greatly reduce the number of images that require human viewing. This system must have low rates of false negatives (missed crystals), possibly at the cost of raising the number of false positives. The image-classification system employs a support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm to classify the blocks making up each image. A new algorithm to find the area within the image that contains the drop is employed. The SVM uses numerical features, based on texture and the Gabor wavelet decomposition, that are calculated for each block. If a block within an image is classified as containing a crystal, then the entire image is classified as containing a crystal. In a study of 375 images, 87 of which contained crystals, a false-negative rate of less than 4% with a false-positive rate of about 40% was consistently achieved. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Union of Crystallography - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {The green fluorescent protein (GFP) creates a fluorophore out of three sequential amino acids by promoting spontaneous posttranslational modifications. Here, we use high-resolution crystallography to characterize GFP variants that not only undergo peptide backbone cyclization but additional denaturation-induced peptide backbone fragmentation, native peptide hydrolysis, and decarboxylation reactions. Our analyses indicate that architectural features that favor GFP peptide cyclization also drive peptide hydrolysis. These results are relevant for the maturation pathways of GFP homologues, such as the kindling fluorescent protein and the Kaede protein, which use backbone cleavage to red-shift the spectral properties of their chromophores. We further propose a photochemical mechanism for the decarboxylation reaction, supporting a role for the GFP protein environment in facilitating radical formation and one-electron chemistry, which may be important in activating oxygen for the oxidation step of chromophore biosynthesis. Together, our results characterize GFP posttranslational modification chemistry with implications for the energetic landscape of backbone cyclization and subsequent reactions, and for the rational design of predetermined spontaneous backbone cyclization and cleavage reactions. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Redox-sensitive variants of the green fluorescent protein (roGFPs) had previously been developed that allow "real-time" monitoring of the redox status of cellular compartments by fluorescence excitation ratiometry. However, the response time of these probes limits the study of certain rapid oxidative events, such as H2O2 bursts in cell signaling. The substitution of up to three positively charged amino acids adjacent to the introduced disulfide in roGFP1 (variants designated roGFP1-R1 through -R14) substantially improved the response rate. The pseudo first-order rate constants for oxidation by H2O2 and reduction by DTT and redox midpoint potentials were determined. The rate constants approximately doubled with each additional positively charged substitution, to nearly an order of magnitude total. The midpoint potentials are highly correlated with the rate increases, becoming more oxidizing with increasing numbers of positive substitutions. Crystal structures of two variants with opposite disulfide oxidation states have been determined: a 2.2 A resolution structure of oxidized "R7" containing two basic substitutions, and a 1.95 A resolution structure of reduced "R8" with one basic and one acidic substitution. Nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) calculations are shown to accurately predict the effects of the substitutions on the rate constants. The effects of the substitutions on dimer formation, relative oxidative midpoint potentials, and oxidation and reduction rates are discussed. roGFPs are demonstrated to constitute an excellent model system for quantitative analysis of factors influencing thiol transfer reactions. roGFP1-R12 is most suitable for use in live cells, due to significantly increased reaction rate and increased pI.},

@article{Yao2006,
abstract = {The ACORN system was originally developed as a means of ab initio solution of protein structures when atomic resolution data were available. The first step is to obtain a starting set of phases, which must be at least slightly better than random. These may be calculated from a fragment of the structure, which can be anything from a single metal atom to a complete molecular-replacement model. A number of standard procedures are available in ACORN to orientate and position such a fragment. The fragment provides initial phases that give the first of a series of maps that are iteratively refined by a dynamic density-modification (DDM) process. Another FFT-based procedure is Sayre-equation refinement (SER), which modifies phases better to satisfy the Sayre equation. With good-quality atomic resolution data, the final outcome of applying DDM and SER is a map similar in appearance to that found from a refined structure, which is readily interpreted by automated procedures. Further development of ACORN now enables structures to be solved with less than atomic resolution data. A critical part of this development is the artificial extension of the data from the observed limit to 1 {\AA} resolution. These extended reflections are allocated unit normalized structure amplitudes and then treated in a similar way to observed reflections except that they are down-weighted in the calculation of maps. ACORN maps, especially at low resolution, tend to show C atoms less well, in particular C$\alpha$ atoms which fall within the first diffraction minimum of their three neighbours. Two new density-modification procedures (DDM1 and DDM2) and a density-enhancement procedure (ENH) have been devised to counter this problem. It is demonstrated that high-quality maps showing individual atoms can be produced with the new ACORN. ACORN has also been demonstrated to be very effective in refining phase sets derived from physical processes such as those using anomalous scattering or isomorphous derivative data. Future work will be directed towards applying ACORN to resolutions down to 2 {\AA}. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Union of Crystallography - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recent 11B NMR studies of the formation of ternary complexes of trypsin, borate, and S1-binding alcohols revealed evidence for an additional binding interaction external to the enzyme active site. We have explored this binding interaction as a prototypical interaction of borate and boronate ligands with residues on the protein surface. NMR studies of trypsin in which the active site is blocked with leupeptin or with the irreversible inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF) indicate the existence of a low-affinity borate binding site with an apparent dissociation constant of 97 mM, measured at pH 8.0. Observation of a field-dependent dynamic frequency shift of the 11B resonance indicates that it corresponds to a complex for which $\omega$$\tau$ ≫ 1. The 0.12 ppm shift difference of the borate resonances measured at 11.75 and 7.05 T, corresponds to a quadrupole coupling constant of 260 kHz. A much larger 2.0 ppm shift is observed in the 11B NMR spectra of trypsin complexed with benzene boronic acid (BBA), leading to a calculated quadrupole coupling constant of 1.1 MHz for this complex. Crystallographic studies identify the second borate binding site as a serine-rich region on the surface of the molecule. Specifically, a complex obtained at pH 10.6 shows a borate ion covalently bonded to the hydroxyl oxygen atoms of Serl64 and Ser167, with additional stabilization coming from two hydrogen-bonding interactions. A similar structure, although with low occupancy (30%), is observed for a trypsin-BBA complex. In this case, the BBA is also observed in the active site, covalently bound in two different conformations to both His57 N$\epsilon$ and Ser195 O$\gamma$. An analysis of pairwise hydroxyl oxygen distances was able to predict the secondary borate binding site in porcine trypsin, and this approach is potentially useful for prediction of borate binding sites on the surfaces of other proteins. However, the distances between the Ser164/Ser167 O$\gamma$ atoms in all of the reported trypsin crystal structures is significantly greater than the O$\gamma$ distances of 2.2 and 1.9 A observed in the trypsin complexes with borate and BBA, respectively. Thus, the ability of the hydroxyl oxygens to adopt a sufficiently close orientation to allow bidentate ligation is a critical limit on the borate binding affinity of surface-accessible serine/threonine/tyrosine residues.},

Here we test and extend the understanding of fluorophore biosynthesis by coupling chemical reduction and anaerobic methodologies with kinetic analyses and protein structure determination. Two high-resolution structures of dithionite-treated GFP variants reveal a previously uncharacterized enolate intermediate form of the chromophore that is viable in generating a fluorophore (t1/2 = 39 min-1) upon exposure to air. Isolation of this enolate intermediate will now allow specific probing of the rate-limiting oxidation step for fluorophore biosynthesis in GFP and its red fluorescent protein homologues. Such targeted characterizations may lead to the design of faster maturing proteins with enhanced applications in biotechnology and cell biology. Moreover, our results reveal how the GFP protein environment mimics enzyme systems, by stabilizing an otherwise high energy enolate intermediate to achieve its post-translational modification.

abstract = {X-ray damage to protein crystals is often assessed on the basis of the degradation of diffraction intensity, yet this measure is not sensitive to the rapid changes that occur at photosensitive groups such as the active sites of metalloproteins. Here, X-ray absorption spectroscopy is used to study the X-ray dose-dependent photoreduction of crystals of the [Fe2S2]-containing metalloprotein putidaredoxin. A dramatic decrease in the rate of photoreduction is observed in crystals cryocooled with liquid helium at 40 K compared with those cooled with liquid nitrogen at 110 K. Whereas structural changes consistent with cluster reduction occur in the active site of the crystal measured at 110 K, no such changes occur in the crystal measured at 40 K, even after an eightfold increase in dose. When the structural results from extended X-ray absorption fine-structure measurements are compared with those obtained by crystallography on this and similar proteins, it is apparent that X-ray-induced photoreduction has had an impact on the crystallographic data and subsequent structure solutions. These results strongly indicate the importance of using liquid-helium-based cooling for metalloprotein crystallography in order to avoid the subtle yet important changes that can take place at the metalloprotein active sites when liquid-nitrogen-based cooling is used. The study also illustrates the need for direct measurement of the redox states of the metals, through X-ray absorption spectroscopy, simultaneously with the crystallographic measurements. {\textcopyright} International Union of Crystallography 2007.},

abstract = {The crystal structure of the cyan-fluorescent Cerulean green fluorescent protein (GFP), a variant of enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP), has been determined to 2.0 {\AA}. Cerulean bears an internal fluorophore composed of an indole moiety derived from Y66W, conjugated to the GFP-like imidazolinone ring via a methylene bridge. Cerulean undergoes highly efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to yellow acceptor molecules and exhibits significantly reduced excited-state heterogeneity. This feature was rationally engineered in ECFP by substituting His148 with an aspartic acid [Rizzo et al. (2004) Nat. Biotechnol. 22, 445], rendering Cerulean useful for fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The X-ray structure is consistent with a single conformation of the chromophore and surrounding residues and may therefore provide a structural rationale for the previously described monoexponential fluorescence decay. Unexpectedly, the carboxyl group of H148D is found in a buried position, directly contacting the indole nitrogen of the chromophore via a bifurcated hydrogen bond. Compared to the similarly constructed ECFP chromophore, the indole group of Cerulean is rotated around the methylene bridge to adopt a cis-coplanar conformation with respect to the imidazolinone ring, resulting in a close edge-to-edge contact of the two ring systems. The double-humped absorbance spectrum persists in single-crystal absorbance measurements, casting doubt on the idea that ground state conformational heterogeneity forms the basis of the two overlapping transitions. At low pH, a blue shift in absorbance of 10-15 nm suggests a pH-induced structural transition that proceeds with a time constant of 47 (±2) min and is reversible. Possible interpretations in terms of chromophore isomerization are presented. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

All three systems showed a very rapid reduction of the heme iron. In chloroperoxidase the change of the ionization state from ferric to ferrous heme is associated with a movement of the heme-coordinating water molecule. The influence of the energy of the incident X-ray photons and of the presence of scavengers on the apparent reduction rate of ferric myoglobin crystals was analyzed. {\textcopyright} 2007 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved.},

The protein, reservoir solutions and seed stocks are pipetted simultaneously using a three-bore dispensing tip in drops of 0.6 $\mu$l total volume.

abstract = {The photophysical properties of most green fluorescent protein mutants (GFPs) are strongly affected by pH. This effect must be carefully taken into account when using GFPs as fluorescent probes or indicators. Usually, the pH-dependence of GFPs is rationalized on the basis of the ionization equilibrium of the chromophore phenol group. Yet many different mutants show spectral behavior that cannot be explained by ionization of this group alone. In this study, we propose a general model of protonation comprising two ionization sites (2S model). Steady-state optical measurements at different pH and temperature and pH-jump relaxation experiments were combined to highlight the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of paradigmatically different GFP variants. Our experiments support the 2S model. For the case of mutants in which E222 is the second protonation site, thermodynamic coupling between this residue's and the chromophore's ionization reactions was demonstrated. In agreement with the 2S model predictions, X-ray analysis of one of these mutants showed the presence of two chromophore populations at high pH. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

The majority of macromolecular data collection is therefore performed at 100 K, yielding diffraction data of higher resolution and allowing structure determination from much smaller crystals. However, at third-generation synchrotron sources radiation damage at 100 K still limits the useful data obtainable from a crystal. For data collection at 15 K, realised by the use of an open-flow helium cryostat, a further reduction of radiation damage is expected. However, no systematic studies have been undertaken so far. In this present study, a total of 54 data sets have been collected from holoferritin and insulin crystals at 15 and 90 K in order to identify the effect of the lower data-collection temperature on the radiation damage. It is shown that data collection at 15 K has only a small positive effect for insulin crystals, whereas for holoferritin crystals radiation damage is reduced by 23% compared with data collection at 90 K. {\textcopyright} International Union of Crystallography 2007.},

As 1,8-ANS interacts with a wide variety of proteins, this is proposed to be a general solution for the automated classification of protein crystallization images and the detection of protein crystals.

abstract = {This study reports the influence of halogens on fluorescence properties of the Aequorea victoria Green Fluorescent Protein variant S65T/T203Y (E 2GFP). Halide binding forms a specific nonfluorescent complex generating a substantial drop of the fluorescence via static quenching. Spectroscopic analysis under different solution conditions reveals high halogen affinity, which is strongly dependent on the pH. This evidences the presence in E2GFP of interacting binding sites for halide ions and for protons. Thermodynamic link and cooperative interaction are assessed demonstrating that binding of one halide ion is associated with the binding of one proton in a cooperative fashion with the formation, in the pH range 4.5-10, of a single fully protonated E2GFP{\textperiodcentered}halogen complex. To resolve the structural determinants of E2GFP sensitivity to halogens, high-resolution crystallographic structures were obtained for the halide-free and I-, Br-, and Cl- bound E2GFP. Remarkably the first high-resolution (1.4 {\AA}) crystallographic structure of a chloride-bound GFP is reported. The chloride ion occupies a specific and unique binding pocket in direct contact (3.4 {\AA}) with the chromophore imidazolidinone aromatic ring. Unanticipated flexibility, strongly modulated by halide ion interactions, is observed in the region surrounding the chromophore. Furthermore molecular dynamics simulations identified E222 residue (along with the chromophore Y66 residue) being in the protonated state when E 2GFP{\textperiodcentered}halogen complex is formed. The impact of these results on high-sensitivity biosensor design will be discussed. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Biophysical Society.},

The power law is fitted over annuli, centred at zero spatial frequency, and the parameters, A and $\alpha$, determined for each spatial frequency range. The variation of the fitted parameters across wedges of fixed polar angle provides a measure of directionality and the deviation from the fitted model can be exploited for classification.

abstract = {Wild type green fluorescent protein (wt-GFP) and the variant S65T/H148D each exhibit two absorption bands, A and B, which are associated with the protonated and deprotonated chromophores, respectively. Excitation of either band leads to green emission. In wt-GFP, excitation of band A (∼395 nm) leads to green emission with a rise time of 10-15 ps, due to excited-state proton transfer (ESPT) from the chromophore hydroxyl group to an acceptor. This process produces an anionic excited-state intermediate I* that subsequently emits a green photon. In the variant S65T/H148D, the A band absorbance maximum is red-shifted to ∼415 nm, and as detailed in the accompanying papers, when the A band is excited, green fluorescence appears with a rise time shorter than the instrument time resolution (∼170 fs). On the basis of the steady-state spectroscopy and high-resolution crystal structures of several variants described herein, it is proposed that in S65T/H148D, the red shift of absorption band A and the ultrafast appearance of green fluorescence upon excitation of band A are due to a very short (≤2.4 {\AA}), and possibly low-barrier, hydrogen bond between the chromophore hydroxyl and introduced Asp148. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

Carboxyl groups of acidic residues (Glu, Asp) losing their definition is one of the major effects observed. Here, the susceptibilities to X-ray damage of acidic residues in tetrameric malate dehydrogenase from Haloarcula marismortui are investigated. The marked excess of acidic residues in this halophilic enzyme makes it an ideal target to determine how specific damage to acidic residues is related to their structural and chemical environment. Four conclusions are drawn. (i) Acidic residues interacting with the side-chains of lysine and arginine residues are less affected by radiation damage than those interacting with serine, threonine and tyrosine side-chains. This suggests that residues with higher pKa values are more vulnerable to damage than those with a lower pKa. However, such a correlation was not found when calculated pK& values were inspected, (ii) Acidic side-chains located in the enzymatic active site are the most radiation-sensitive ones, (iii) Acidic residues in the internal cavity formed by the four monomers and those involved in crystal contacts appear to be particularly susceptible, (iv) No correlation was found between radiation susceptibility and solvent accessibility. {\textcopyright} 2007 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved.},

The aim of this concise review is to examine whether analogous approaches can be utilized to alleviate the X-ray radiation damage problem in synchrotron macromolecular crystallography. The critical discussion of this question is preceded by presentation of background material on modern technical procedures with electron beam instruments using 300-400 kV accelerating voltage, low-dose exposures for data recording, and protection of protein specimens by cryogenic cooling; these practical approaches to dealing with electron radiation damage currently permit best resolution levels of 6 {\AA} (0.6 nm) for single particle specimens, and of 1.9 {\AA} for two-dimensional membrane protein crystals. Final determination of the potential effectiveness and practical value of using such new or unconventional ideas will necessitate showing, by experimental testing, that these produce significantly improved protection of three-dimensional protein crystals during synchrotron X-ray diffraction. {\textcopyright} 2007 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved.},

Crystallographic statistics, such as the values of lattice constants, Rmerge and I/$\sigma$(I), for each data set degraded at all nine energies as the exposure time for each crystal increased. In all data sets, radiation damage was observed after the absorbed dose exceeded 106 Gy. However, from the point of view of crystallographic statistics normalized to the absorbed dose, no clear dependence on photon energy was observed in these results. Structural refinement showed that the average B-factor for the last data set was larger than that for the first data set at all energies tested. However, no energy dependence of radiation damage on B-factor was found. Furthermore, disruption of disulfide bonds due to radiation damage was observed in electron density maps even at the highest photon energy (33 keV) used in this study. Therefore, these results suggest that radiation damage in the energy range investigated could be evaluated based on absorbed dose without energy dependence, and that it is important to minimize the absorbed dose in a crystal sample for obtaining an accurate protein structure. {\textcopyright} 2007 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {The radiation-induced disordering of selenomethionine (SeMet) side chains represents a significant impediment to protein structure solution. Not only does the increased B-factor of these sites result in a serious drop in phasing power, but some sites decay much faster than others in the same unit cell. These radiolabile SeMet side chains decay faster than high-order diffraction spots with dose, making it difficult to detect this kind of damage by inspection of the diffraction pattern. The selenium X-ray absorbance near-edge spectrum (XANES) from samples containing SeMet was found to change significantly after application of X-ray doses of 10-100 MGy. Most notably, the sharp 'white line' feature near the canonical Se edge disappears. The change was attributed to breakage of the C$\gamma$-Se bond in SeMet. This spectral change was used as a probe to measure the decay rate of SeMet with X-ray dose in cryo-cooled samples. Two protein crystal types and 15 solutions containing free SeMet amino acid were examined. The damage rate was influenced by the chemical and physical condition of the sample, and the half-decaying dose for the selenium XANES signal ranged from 5 to 43 MGy. These decay rates were 34- to 3.8-fold higher than the rate at which the Se atoms interacted directly with X-ray photons, so the damage mechanism must be a secondary effect. Samples that cooled to a more crystalline state generally decayed faster than samples that cooled to an amorphous solid. The single exception was a protein crystal where a nanocrystalline cryoprotectant had a protective effect. Lowering the pH, especially with ascorbic or nitric acids, had a protective effect, and SeMet lifetime increased monotonically with decreasing sample temperature (down to 93 K). The SeMet lifetime in one protein crystal was the same as that of the free amino acid, and the longest SeMet lifetime measured was found in the other protein crystal type. This protection was found to arise from the folded structure of the protein molecule. A mechanism to explain observed decay rates involving the damaging species following the electric field lines around protein molecules is proposed. {\textcopyright} 2007 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {The green fluorescent protein (GFP) creates its fluorophore by promoting spontaneous peptide backbone cyclization and amino acid oxidation chemistry on its own Ser65, Tyr66, Gly67 tripeptide sequence. Here we use high-resolution crystallography and mutational analyses to characterize GFP variants that undergo backbone cyclization followed by either anticipated chromophore synthesis via Y66F C$\alpha$-C$\beta$ double-bond formation or unprecedented loss of a Y66F benzyl moiety via C$\alpha$-C$\beta$ bond cleavage. We discovered a Y66F cleavage variant that subsequently incorporates an oxygen atom, likely from molecular oxygen, at the Y66 C$\alpha$ position. The post-translational products identified from these Y66F GFP structures support a common intermediate that partitions between C$\alpha$-C$\beta$ oxidation and homolytic cleavage pathways. Our data indicate that Glu222 is the branchpoint control for this partitioning step and also influences subsequent oxygen incorporation reactions. From these results, we propose mechanisms for Y66F C$\alpha$-C$\beta$ cleavage, oxygen incorporation, and chromophore biosynthesis with shared features that include radical chemistry. By revealing how GFP and RFP protein environments steer chemistry to favor fluorophore biosynthesis and disfavor alternative reactivity, we identify strategies for protein design. The proposed, common, one-electron oxidized, radical intermediate for post-translation modifications in the GFP family has general implications for how proteins drive and control spontaneous post-translational chemical modifications in the absence of metal ions. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

@article{Lohman2008,
abstract = {Green fluorescent protein (GFP) indicators were previously developed that rapidly and quantitatively respond to changes in the thiol/disulfide equilibrium within subcellular compartments. In these indicators, surface-exposed cysteines residues were introduced so as to form a labile redox-active disulfide that in turn controls the emission properties of the internal chromophore. The biosensors have been shown to be effective reporters of the thiol/disulfide status within reducing compartments such as the mitochondria and cytosol for several cell types. However, due to the high thermodynamic stability of the introduced disulfide bond, the indicators are not useful for quantitative analysis within more oxidizing compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we report the development of a new family of GFP-based redox indicators (roGFP1-iX) in which the thermodynamic stability of the disulfide is substantially lowered by insertion of a single amino acid into the main chain, adjacent to cysteine 147. The insertions result in indicators with midpoint potentials of -229 to -246 mV and are thus better suited for study of relatively oxidizing subcellular compartments. Atomic resolution crystallographic analyses suggest that two important factors act to destabilize the disulfide linkage in roGFP1-iX. In the oxidized state, an unusual non-proline cis-peptide bond adjacent to one of the cysteines introduces geometric strain into the system, while in the reduced state, a dramatic loop opening lowers the effective concentration of the reacting species. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

The radiation damage can lead to radiation-induced changes and reduction of the metal sites. One of the research fields where these concerns have been comprehensively addressed is the study of the reaction intermediates of the heme peroxidase and oxygenase reaction cycles. For both the resting states and the high-valent intermediates, the X-rays used in the structure determination have given undesired side effects through radiation-induced changes to the trapped intermediates. However, X-rays have been used to generate and trap the peroxy/hydroperoxy state in crystals. In this review, the structural work and the influence of X-rays on these intermediates in myoglobin are summarized and viewed in light of analogous studies on similar intermediates in peroxidases and oxygenases.},

The crystal structure of xylanase II has been determined with a flux density of about 3 × 1010 photons s-1 $\mu$m-2 at the sample. Two sets of diffraction images collected from different sized crystals were shown to comprise data of good quality, which allowed a 1.5 {\AA} resolution xylanase II structure to be obtained. The main conclusion of this experiment is that a high-resolution diffraction pattern can be obtained from 20 $\mu$m3 crystal volume, corresponding to about 2 × 108 unit cells. Despite the high irradiation dose in this case, it was possible to obtain an excellent high-resolution map and it could be concluded from the individual atomic B-factor patterns that there was no evidence of significant radiation damage. The photoelectron escape from a narrow diffraction channel is a possible reason for reduced radiation damage as indicated by Monte Carlo simulations. These results open many new opportunities in scanning protein microcrystallography and make random data collection from microcrystals a real possibility, therefore enabling structures to be solved from much smaller crystals than previously anticipated as long as the crystallites are well ordered. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Union of Crystallography - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {X-ray-induced redox changes can lead to incorrect assignments of the functional states of metals in metalloprotein crystals. The need for on-line monitoring of the status of metal ions (and other chromophores) during protein crystallography experiments is of growing importance with the use of intense synchrotron X-ray beams. Significant efforts are therefore being made worldwide to combine different spectroscopies in parallel with X-ray crystallographic data collection. Here the implementation and utilization of optical and X-ray absorption spectroscopies on the modern macromolecular crystallography (MX) beamline 10, at the SRS, Daresbury Laboratory, is described. This beamline is equipped with a dedicated monolithic energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence detector, allowing X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements to be made in situ on the same crystal used to record the diffraction data. In addition, an optical microspectrophotometer has been incorporated on the beamline, thus facilitating combined MX, XAS and optical spectroscopic measurements. By uniting these techniques it is also possible to monitor the status of optically active and optically silent metal centres present in a crystal at the same time. This unique capability has been applied to observe the results of crystallographic data collection on crystals of nitrite reductase from Alcaligenes xylosoxidans, which contains both type-1 and type-2 Cu centres. It is found that the type-1 Cu centre photoreduces quickly, resulting in the loss of the 595 nm peak in the optical spectrum, while the type-2 Cu centre remains in the oxidized state over a much longer time period, for which independent confirmation is provided by XAS data as this centre has an optical spectrum which is barely detectable using microspectrophotometry. This example clearly demonstrates the importance of using two on-line methods, spectroscopy and XAS, for identifying well defined redox states of metalloproteins during crystallographic data collection. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Union of Crystallography.},

Many parts of the multistep process to produce the three-dimensional structural model have been automated, especially through various structural genomics projects. A key step is the production of crystals for diffraction. The target macromolecule is combined with a large and chemically diverse set of cocktails with some leading ideally, but infrequently, to crystallization. A variety of outcomes will be observed during these screening experiments that typically require human interpretation for classification. Human interpretation is neither scalable nor objective, highlighting the need to develop an automatic computer-based image classification. As a first step towards automated image classification, 147 456 images representing crystallization experiments from 96 different macromolecular samples were manually classified. Each image was classified by three experts into seven predefined categories or their combinations. The resulting data where all three observers are in agreement provides one component of a truth set for the development and rigorous testing of automated image-classification systems and provides information about the chemical cocktails used for crystallization.

abstract = {A colorful variety of fluorescent proteins (FPs) from marine invertebrates are utilized as genetically encoded markers for live cell imaging. The increased demand for advanced imaging techniques drives a continuous search for FPs with new and improved properties. Many useful FPs have been isolated from species adapted to sun-flooded habitats such as tropical coral reefs. It has yet remained unknown if species expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-like proteins also exist in the darkness of the deep sea. Using a submarine-based and -operated fluorescence detection system in the Gulf of Mexico, we discovered ceriantharians emitting bright green fluorescence in depths between 500 and 600 m and identified a GFP, named cerFP505, with bright fluorescence emission peaking at 505 nm. Spectroscopic studies showed that ∼15% of the protein bulk feature reversible ON/OFF photoswitching that can be induced by alternating irradiation with blue und near-UV light. Despite being derived from an animal adapted to essentially complete darkness and low temperatures, cerFP505 maturation in living mammalian cells at 37°C, its brightness and photostability are comparable to those of EGFP and cmFP512 from shallow water species. Therefore, our findings disclose the deep sea as a potential source of GFP-like molecular marker proteins. {\textcopyright} 2008 Vogt et al.},

The system can be incorporated into existing crystallization-analysis pipelines, whereby specialists examine images as they normally would with the exception that the images appear in rank order according to a simple real-valued score. Promising results are shown for 319 112 images associated with 150 structures solved by the Joint Center for Structural Genomics pipeline during the 2006-2007 year.

abstract = {Structural data play a central role in understanding biological function at the molecular level. At present, the majority of high-resolution structural data about biological macromolecules and their complexes originates from crystallography. In crystal structure determination, the major hurdle to overcome is the production of crystals of sufficient size and quality. High-flux x-ray beams with diameters of a few micrometers or less help to alleviate this problem as small beams allow the use of small crystals or scanning of large crystals for regions of acceptable diffraction. Using sophisticated x-ray optics and mechanics with submicrometer precision, Riekel et al. [Acta Crystallogr., Sect. D: Biol. Crystallogr., 64, 158-166 (2008)] have recently demonstrated that an x-ray beam of 1 $\mu$m can be used to determine the crystal structure of a protein to a resolution of 1.5 {\AA}. The smallest volume from which usable diffraction data were collected amounted to 20 $\mu$m 3, corresponding to not more than 2×10 8 unit cells. In a diffraction volume of micrometer dimensions, radiation damage is expected to be reduced with respect to large volumes as a significant fraction of the photoelectrons produced by the incident radiation escapes from the diffracting volume before dissipating their energy. The possibility to make use of small and/or inhomogeneous crystals in combination with a possible reduction in radiation damage due to size effects has the potential to make many more systems amenable to crystal structure analysis. {\textcopyright} HFSP Publishing.},

This results from the uniform addition of mother liquor used to stabilize the microcrystalline seed stock, which is usually the mother liquor that resulted in successful crystal growth. It was found that there is an overlap in identified crystallization leads between addition of seed and addition of the mother liquor used to stabilize the seed. This indicates that additional crystallization 'hits' primarily (but not exclusively) arise from changes in the drop composition, not the introduction of seeds. A complementary automated microseeding protocol is proposed as a novel approach for biasing drops in a screen with many of the most popular precipitants. {\textcopyright} International Union of Crystallography 2008.},

abstract = {Mercury is a ubiquitous pollutant that when absorbed is extremely toxic to a wide variety of biochemical processes. Mercury (II) is a strong, "invisible" poison that is rapidly absorbed by tissues of the intestinal tract, kidneys, and liver upon ingestion. In this study, a novel fluorescence-based biosensor is presented that allows for the direct monitoring of the uptake and distribution of the metal under noninvasive in vivo conditions. With the introduction of a cysteine residue at position 205, located in close proximity to the chromophore, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from Aequorea victoria was converted into a highly specific biosensor for this metal ion. The mutant protein exhibits a dramatic absorbance and fluorescence change upon mercuration at neutral pH. Absorbance and fluorescence properties with respect to the metal concentration exhibit sigmoidal binding behavior with a detection limit in the low nanomolar range. Time-resolved binding studies indicate rapid subsecond binding of the metal to the protein. The crystal structures obtained of mutant eGFP205C indicate a possible access route of the metal into the core of the protein. To our knowledge, this engineered protein is a first example of a biosensor that allows for noninvasive and real-time imaging of mercury uptake in a living cell. A major advantage is that its expression can be genetically controlled in many organisms to enable unprecedented studies of tissue specific mercury uptake.},

@article{Steiner2008,
abstract = {Background: Proline residues affect protein folding and stability via cis/trans isomerization of peptide bonds and by the C$\gamma$-exo or -endo puckering of their pyrrolidine rings. Peptide bond conformation as well as puckering propensity can be manipulated by proper choice of ring substituents, e.g. C$\gamma$-fluorination. Synthetic chemistry has routinely exploited ring-substituted proline analogs in order to change, modulate or control folding and stability of peptides. Methodology/Principal Findings: In order to transmit this synthetic strategy to complex proteins, the ten proline residues of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were globally replaced by (4R)- (4S)-fluoroprolines (FPro). By this approach, we expected to affect the cis/trans peptidyl-proline bond isomerization and pyrrolidine ring puckering, wich are responsible for the slow folding of this protein. Expression of both protein variants occurred at levels comparable to the parent protein, but the (4R)-FPro-EGFP resulted in irreversibly unfolded inclusion bodies, whereas the (4S)-FPro-EGFP led to a soluble fluorescent protein. Upon thermal denaturation, refolding of this variant occurs at significantly higher rates than the parent EGFP. Comparative inspection of the X-ray structures of EGFP and (4S)-FPro-EGFP allowed to correlate the significantly improved unfolding with the C$\gamma$-endo puckering of the pyrrolidine rings, which is favored by 4S-fluorination, and to lesser extents with the cis/trans isomerization of the prolines. Conclusions/Significance: We discovered that the folding rates and stability of GFP are affected to a lesser extent by cis/trans isomerization of the proline bonds than by the puckering of pyrrolidine rings. In the C$\gamma$-endo conformation the fluorine atoms are positioned in the structural context of the GFP such that a network of favorable local interactions is established. From these results the combined use of synthetic amino acids along with detailed structural knowledge and existing protein engineering methods can be envisioned as a promising strategy for the design of complex tailor-made proteins and even cellular structures of superior properties compared to the native forms. {\textcopyright} 2008 Steiner et al.},

abstract = {A new strategy is presented to reduce primary X-ray damage in macromolecular crystallography. The strategy is based on separating the diffracting and damaged regions as much as feasible. The source of the radiation damage to macromolecular crystals is from two primary mechanisms: the direct excitations of electrons by absorption, and inelastic scattering of the X-rays. The first produces photoelectrons with their accompanying Auger electrons from relaxation of the core hole and the second creates Compton electrons. The properties of these two mechanisms and calculations of primary X-ray damage quantify how to modify the spatial distribution of X-rays to reduce the deleterious effects of radiation damage. By focusing the incident X-rays into vertical stripes, it is estimated that the survival (the time during which quality diffraction data can be obtained with a given X-ray flux) of large crystals can be increased by at least a factor of 1.6, while for very small platelet crystals the survival can be increased by up to a factor of 14. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Union of Crystallography - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {X-rays interact with biological matter and cause damage. Proteins and other macromolecules are damaged primarily by ionizing X-ray photons and secondarily by reactive radiolytic chemical species. In particular, protein molecules are damaged during X-ray diffraction experiments with protein crystals, which is, in many cases, a serious hindrance to structure solution. The local X-ray-induced structural changes of the protein molecule have been studied using a number of model systems. However, it is still not well understood whether these local chemical changes lead to global structural changes in protein and what the mechanism is. We present experimental evidence at atomic resolution indicating the movement of large parts of the protein globule together with bound water molecules in the early stages of radiation damage to the protein crystal. The data were obtained from a crystal cryocooled to $\sim$ 100 K and diffracting to 1 Ǻ. The movement of the protein structural elements occurs simultaneously with the decarboxylation of several glutamate and aspartate residues that mediate contacts between moving protein structural elements and with the rearrangement of the water network. The analysis of the anisotropy of atomic displacement parameters reveals that the observed atomic movements occur at different rates in different unit cells of the crystal. Thus, the examination of the cooperative atomic movement enables us to better understand how radiation-induced local chemical and structural changes of the protein molecule eventually lead to disorder in protein crystals. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Investigation of radiation damage in protein crystals has progressed in several directions over the past couple of years. There have been improvements in the basic procedures such as calibration of the incident X-ray intensity and calculation of the dose likely to be deposited in a crystal of known size and composition with this intensity. There has been increased emphasis on using additional techniques such as optical, Raman or X-ray spectroscopy to complement X-ray diffraction. Apparent discrepancies between the results of different techniques can be explained by the fact that they are sensitive to different length scales or to changes in the electronic state rather than to movement of atoms. Investigations have been carried out at room temperature as well as cryo-temperatures and, in both cases, with the introduction of potential scavenger molecules. These and other studies are leading to an overall description of the changes which can occur when a protein crystal is irradiated with X-rays at both cryo- and room temperatures. Results from crystallographic and spectroscopic radiation-damage experiments can be reconciled with other studies in the field of radiation physics and chemistry.},

abstract = {X-rays can produce a high concentration of radicals within cryo-cooled macromolecular crystals. Some radicals have large extinction coefficients in the visible (VIS) range of the electromagnetic spectrum, and can be observed optically and spectrally. An online microspectrophotometer with high temporal resolution has been constructed that is capable of measuring UV/VIS absorption spectra (200–1100 nm) during X-ray data collection. The typical X-ray-induced blue colour that is characteristic of a wide range of cryo-conditions has been identified as trapped solvated electrons. Disulphide-containing proteins are shown to form disulphide radicals at millimolar concentrations, with absorption maxima around 400 nm. The solvated electrons and the disulphide radicals seem to have a lifetime in the range of seconds up to minutes at 100 K. The temperature dependence of the kinetics of X-ray-induced radical formation is different for the solvated electrons compared with the disulphide radicals. The online microspectrophotometer provides a technique complementary to X-ray diffraction for analysing and characterizing intermediates and redox states of proteins and enzymes.},

@article{Barker2009,
abstract = {The advent of highly intense wiggler and undulator beamlines has reintroduced the problem of X-ray radiation damage in protein crystals even at cryogenic temperatures (100 K). Although cryocrystallography can be utilized for the majority of protein crystals, certain macromolecular crystals ( e.g. of viruses) suffer large increases in mosaicity upon flash cooling and data are still collected at room temperature (293 K). An alternative mechanism to cryocooling for prolonging crystal lifetime is the use of radioprotectants. These compounds are able to scavenge the free radical species formed upon X-ray irradiation which are thought to be responsible for part of the observed damage. Three putative radioprotectants, ascorbate, 1,4-benzoquinone and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidone (TEMP), were tested for their ability to prolong lysozyme crystal lifetimes at 293 K. Plots of relative summed intensity against dose were used as a metric to assess radioprotectant ability: ascorbate and 1,4-benzoquinone appear to be effective, whereas studies on TEMP were inconclusive. Ascorbate, which scavenges OH^{\bullet} radicals ( k OH = 8 × 10 9 M −1 s −1 ) and electrons with a lower rate constant ( k e-(aq) = 3.0 × 10 8 M −1 s −1 ), doubled the crystal dose tolerance, whereas 1,4-benzoquinone, which also scavenges both OH^{\bullet} radicals ( k OH = 1.2 × 10 9 M −1 s −1 ) and electrons ( k e-(aq) = 1.2 × 10 10 M −1 s −1 ), offered a ninefold increase in dose tolerance at the dose rates used. Pivotally, these preliminary results on a limited number of samples show that the two scavengers also induced a striking change in the dose dependence of the intensity decay from a first-order to a zeroth-order process.},

The purpose of this paper is to serve as a rough guide to radiation damage issues, and to provide references to the more exacting and detailed work. No attempt has been made to report precise numbers (a factor of two is considered satisfactory), and, since there are aspects of radiation damage that are demonstrably unpredictable, the `worst case scenario' as well as the `average crystal' are discussed in terms of the practicalities of data collection.},

abstract = {Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its variants have been used as fluorescent reporters in a variety of applications for monitoring dynamic processes in cells and organisms, including gene expression, protein localization, and intracellular dynamics. GFP fluorescence is stable, species-independent, and can be monitored noninvasively in living cells by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, or macroscopic imaging techniques. Owing to the presence of a phenol group on the chromophore, most GFP variants display pH-sensitive absorption and fluorescence bands. Such behavior has been exploited to genetically engineer encodable pH indicators for studies of pH regulation within specific intracellular compartments that cannot be probed using conventional pH-sensitive dyes. These pH indicators contributed to shedding light on a number of cell functions for which intracellular pH is an important modulator. In this review we discuss the photophysical properties that make GFPs so special as pH indicators for in vivo use and we describe the probes that are utilized most by the scientific community. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

The promoters for Acanthamoeba TPBF and GAPDH genes were used to drive constitutive expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in stably transfected Acanthamoeba. Based initially on fluorescence microscopy and SDS-PAGE analysis of EGFP, both promoters produce robust expression of EGFP, with the highest level obtained from the GAPDH gene promoter in cells grown in low concentrations of neomycin G418. Purification of EGFP from lysates of 22-ml cultures by conventional chromatography yielded approximately 1.1 mg of EGFP, a value that extrapolates to 50 mg per liter of cell culture.

abstract = {Radiation damage is the major impediment for obtaining structural information from biological samples by using ionizing radiation such as x-rays or electrons. The knowledge of underlying processes especially at cryogenic temperatures is still fragmentary, and a consistent mechanism has not been found yet. By using a combination of single-crystal x-ray diffraction, small-angle scattering, and qualitative and quantitative radiolysis experiments, we show that hydrogen gas, formed inside the sample during irradiation, rather than intramolecular bond cleavage between non-hydrogen atoms, is mainly responsible for the loss of high-resolution information and contrast in diffraction experiments and microscopy. The experiments that are presented in this paper cover a temperature range between 5 and 160 K and reveal that the commonly used temperature in x-ray crystallography of 100 K is not optimal in terms of minimizing radiation damage and thereby increasing the structural information obtainable in a single experiment. At 50 K, specific radiation damage to disulfide bridges is reduced by a factor of 4 compared to 100 K, and samples can tolerate a factor of 2.6 and 3.9 higher dose, as judged by the increase of R free values of elastase and cubic insulin crystals, respectively.},

abstract = {In vitro studies have shown that the phosphoprotein osteopontin (OPN) inhibits the nucleation and growth of hydroxyapatite (HA) and other biominerals. In vivo, OPN is believed to prevent the calcification of soft tissues. However, the nature of the interaction between OPN and HA is not understood. In the computational part of the present study, we used molecular dynamics simulations to predict the adsorption of 19 peptides, each 16 amino acids long and collectively covering the entire sequence of OPN, to the {100} face of HA. This analysis showed that there is an inverse relationship between predicted strength of adsorption and peptide isoelectric point (P < 0.0001). Analysis of the OPN sequence by PONDR (Predictor of Naturally Disordered Regions) indicated that OPN sequences predicted to adsorb well to HA are highly disordered. In the experimental part of the study, we synthesized phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides corresponding to OPN sequences 65-80 (pSHDHMDDDDDDDDDGD) and 220-235 (pSHEpSTEQSDAIDpSAEK). In agreement with the PONDR analysis, these were shown by circular dichroism spectroscopy to be largely disordered. A constantcomposition/ seeded growth assay was used to assess the HA-inhibiting potencies of the synthetic peptides. The phosphorylated versions of OPN65-80 (IC50 = 1.93 $\mu$g/ml) and OPN220-235 (IC 50 = 1.48 $\mu$g/ml) are potent inhibitors of HA growth, as is the nonphosphorylated version of OPN65-80 (IC50 = 2.97 $\mu$g/ml); the nonphosphorylated version of OPN220-235 has no measurable inhibitory activity. These findings suggest that the adsorption of acidic proteins to Ca 2+-rich crystal faces of biominerals is governed by electrostatics and is facilitated by conformational flexibility of the polypeptide chain. {\textcopyright} 2010 Azzopardi et al.},

abstract = {In macromolecular crystallography, the acquisition of a complete set of diffraction intensities typically involves a high cumulative dose of X-ray radiation. In the process of data acquisition, the irradiated crystal lattice undergoes a broad range of chemical and physical changes. These result in the gradual decay of diffraction intensities, accompanied by changes in the macroscopic organization of crystal lattice order and by localized changes in electron density that, owing to complex radiation chemistry, are specific for a particular macromolecule. The decay of diffraction intensities is a well defined physical process that is fully correctable during scaling and merging analysis and therefore, while limiting the amount of diffraction, it has no other impact on phasing procedures. Specific chemical changes, which are variable even between different crystal forms of the same macromolecule, are more difficult to predict, describe and correct in data. Appearing during the process of data collection, they result in gradual changes in structure factors and therefore have profound consequences in phasing procedures. Examples of various combinations of radiation-induced changes are presented and various considerations pertinent to the determination of the best strategies for handling diffraction data analysis in representative situations are discussed.},

abstract = {Coot is a molecular-graphics application for model building and validation of biological macromolecules. The program displays electron-density maps and atomic models and allows model manipulations such as idealization, real-space refinement, manual rotation/translation, rigid-body fitting, ligand search, solvation, mutations, rotamers and Ramachandran idealization. Furthermore, tools are provided for model validation as well as interfaces to external programs for refinement, validation and graphics. The software is designed to be easy to learn for novice users, which is achieved by ensuring that tools for common tasks are `discoverable' through familiar user-interface elements (menus and toolbars) or by intuitive behaviour (mouse controls). Recent developments have focused on providing tools for expert users, with customisable key bindings, extensions and an extensive scripting interface. The software is under rapid development, but has already achieved very widespread use within the crystallographic community. The current state of the software is presented, with a description of the facilities available and of some of the underlying methods employed.},

abstract = {X-ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation (SR) has revealed the atomic structures of numerous biological macromolecules including proteins and protein complexes, nucleic acids and their protein complexes, viruses, membrane proteins and drug targets. The bright SR X-ray beam with its small divergence has made the study of weakly diffracting crystals of large biological molecules possible. The ability to tune the wavelength of the SR beam to the absorption edge of certain elements has allowed anomalous scattering to be exploited for phase determination. We review the developments at synchrotron sources and beamlines from the early days to the present time, and discuss the significance of the results in providing a deeper understanding of the biological function, the design of new therapeutic molecules and time-resolved studies of dynamic events using pump–probe techniques. Radiation damage, a problem with bright X-ray sources, has been partially alleviated by collecting data at low temperature (100 K) but work is ongoing. In the most recent development, free electron laser sources can offer a peak brightness of hard X-rays approximately 10 8 times brighter than that achieved at SR sources. We describe briefly how early experiments at FLASH and Linear Coherent Light Source have shown exciting possibilities for the future.},

abstract = {The environment of individual tryptophans in known protein structures and the effectiveness of four commercial robotic UV microscopes to illuminate tryptophan-containing protein crystals by either tryptophan fluorescence (epi-illumination) or absorbance (transmission) are evaluated. In agreement with other studies, tryptophan residues are found on average to be largely buried in protein structures (with ∼84% of their surface area buried) and to be surrounded by partially polar microenvironments (with ∼43% of their surface area covered by polar residues), which suggests an inherent degree of fluorescence signal quenching. In bacterial genomes, up to one-third (∼18.5% on average) of open reading frames are deficient in tryptophan. In the laboratory, because of the attenuation of UV light by the media commonly used in sitting-drop and hanging-drop crystallization trials, it was often necessary to simplify the light path by manually removing or inverting the supporting media. Prolonged exposure (minutes) to UV light precipitates some protein samples. The absorbance spectra of many commercially available media in crystallization trials are presented. The advantages of using tryptophan absorbance over fluorescence for characterizing crystals are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Union of Crystallography All rights reserved.},

An efficient evaluation of the increased amount of crystallization trials in order to identify successful experiments is now urgently required. A novel approach is presented for the visualization of crystallization experiments using fluorescence from trace amounts of a nonspecific dye. The fluorescence images obtained strongly contrast protein crystals against other phenomena, such as precipitation and phase separation. Novel software has been developed to quantitatively evaluate the crystallization outcome based on a biophysical metric correlated with voxel protein concentration. In >1500 trials, 85.6% of the successful crystallization experiments were correctly identified, yielding a 50% reduction in the number of `missed hits' compared with current automated approaches. The use of the method in the crystallization of three previously uncharacterized proteins from the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum is further demonstrated.},

abstract = {In this work, classic intensity formulae were united with an empirical spot-fading model in order to calculate the diameter of a spherical crystal that will scatter the required number of photons per spot at a desired resolution over the radiation-damage-limited lifetime. The influences of molecular weight, solvent content, Wilson B factor, X-ray wavelength and attenuation on scattering power and dose were all included. Taking the net photon count in a spot as the only source of noise, a complete data set with a signal-to-noise ratio of 2 at 2 {\AA} resolution was predicted to be attainable from a perfect lysozyme crystal sphere 1.2 µm in diameter and two different models of photoelectron escape reduced this to 0.5 or 0.34 µm. These represent 15-fold to 700-fold less scattering power than the smallest experimentally determined crystal size to date, but the gap was shown to be consistent with the background scattering level of the relevant experiment. These results suggest that reduction of background photons and diffraction spot size on the detector are the principal paths to improving crystallographic data quality beyond current limits.},

@article{Warkentin2010,
abstract = {The temperature-dependence of radiation damage to thaumatin crystals between T = 300 and 100 K is reported. The amount of damage for a given dose decreases sharply as the temperature decreases from 300 to 220 K and then decreases more gradually on further cooling below the protein-solvent glass transition. Two regimes of temperature-activated behavior were observed. At temperatures above ∼200 K the activation energy of 18.0 kJ mol-1 indicates that radiation damage is dominated by diffusive motions in the protein and solvent. At temperatures below ∼200 K the activation energy is only 1.00 kJ mol-1, which is of the order of the thermal energy. Similar activation energies describe the temperature-dependence of radiation damage to a variety of solvent-free small-molecule organic crystals over the temperature range T = 300-80 K. It is suggested that radiation damage in this regime is vibrationally assisted and that the freezing-out of amino-acid scale vibrations contributes to the very weak temperature-dependence of radiation damage below ∼80 K. Analysis using the radiation-damage model of Blake and Phillips [Blake & Phillips (1962), Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation at the Molecular Level, pp. 183-191] indicates that large-scale conformational and molecular motions are frozen out below T = 200 K but become increasingly prevalent and make an increasing contribution to damage at higher temperatures. Possible alternative mechanisms for radiation damage involving the formation of hydrogen-gas bubbles are discussed and discounted. These results have implications for mechanistic studies of proteins and for studies of the protein glass transition. They also suggest that data collection at T ≃ 220 K may provide a viable alternative for structure determination when cooling-induced disorder at T = 100 is excessive. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Union of Crystallography.},

abstract = {A typical diffraction experiment will generate many images and data sets from different crystals in a very short time. This creates a challenge for the high-throughput operation of modern synchrotron beamlines as well as for the subsequent data processing. Novice users in particular may feel overwhelmed by the tables, plots and numbers that the different data-processing programs and software packages present to them. Here, some of the more common problems that a user has to deal with when processing a set of images that will finally make up a processed data set are shown, concentrating on difficulties that may often show up during the first steps along the path of turning the experiment (i.e. data collection) into a model (i.e. interpreted electron density). Difficulties such as unexpected crystal forms, issues in crystal handling and suboptimal choices of data-collection strategies can often be dealt with, or at least diagnosed, by analysing specific data characteristics during processing. In the end, one wants to distinguish problems over which one has no immediate control once the experiment is finished from problems that can be remedied a posteriori. A new software package, autoPROC, is also presented that combines third-party processing programs with new tools and an automated workflow script that is intended to provide users with both guidance and insight into the offline processing of data affected by the difficulties mentioned above, with particular emphasis on the automated treatment of multi-sweep data sets collected on multi-axis goniostats.},

abstract = {X-ray crystallography provides the vast majority of macromolecular structures, but the success of the method relies on growing crystals of sufficient size. In conventional measurements, the necessary increase in X-ray dose to record data from crystals that are too small leads to extensive damage before a diffraction signal can be recorded. It is particularly challenging to obtain large, well-diffracting crystals of membrane proteins, for which fewer than 300 unique structures have been determined despite their importance in all living cells. Here we present a method for structure determination where single-crystal X-ray diffraction snapshotsg are collected from a fully hydrated stream of nanocrystals using femtosecond pulses from a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. We prove this concept with nanocrystals of photosystem I, one of the largest membrane protein complexes. More than 3,000,000 diffraction patterns were collected in this study, and a three-dimensional data set was assembled from individual photosystem I nanocrystals (4200nm to 21/4m in size). We mitigate the problem of radiation damage in crystallography by using pulses briefer than the timescale of most damage processes. This offers a new approach to structure determination of macromolecules that do not yield crystals of sufficient size for studies using conventional radiation sources or are particularly sensitive to radiation damage. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Though the radiation dose was moderate, a selective disruption of a bromine-inhibitor bond during the experiment was observed while the protein appears unaffected. A covalent bond to bromine is cleaved and the displaced atom is not scattered throughout the crystal but can most likely be assigned as a bromide to an additional difference electron density peak observed in the structure. The bromide relocates to an adjacent unoccupied site where promising interactions to protein residues stabilize its position. These findings were verified by a second similar structure determined with considerably higher radiation dose (PDB code 3onb). {\textcopyright} 2011 International Union of Crystallography.},

abstract = {High resolution protein crystallography using synchrotron radiation is one of the most powerful tools in modern biology. Improvements in resolution have arisen from the use of X-ray beamlines with higher brightness and flux and the development of advanced detectors. However, it is increasingly recognised that the benefits brought by these advances have an associated cost, namely deleterious effects of X-ray radiation on the sample (radiation damage). In particular, X-ray induced reduction and damage to redox centres has been shown to occur much more rapidly than other radiation damage effects, such as loss of resolution or damage to disulphide bridges. Selection of an appropriate combination of in-situ single crystal spectroscopies during crystallographic experiments, such as UV-visible absorption and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAFS), allows for effective monitoring of redox states in protein crystals in parallel with structure determination. Such approaches are also essential in cases where catalytic intermediate species are generated by exposure to the X-ray beam. In this article, we provide a number of examples in which multiple single crystal spectroscopies have been key to understanding the redox status of Fe and Cu centres in crystal structures.

The size of the PDB creates new opportunities to validate structures by comparison with the existing database, and the now-mandatory deposition of structure factors creates new opportunities to validate the underlying diffraction data. These developments highlighted the need for a new assessment of validation criteria. The Task Force recommends that a small set of validation data be presented in an easily understood format, relative to both the full PDB and the applicable resolution class, with greater detail available to interested users. Most importantly, we recommend that referees and editors judging the quality of structural experiments have access to a concise summary of well-established quality indicators. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The rate of radiation damage to macromolecular crystals at both room temperature and 100 K has previously been shown to be reduced by the use of certain radical scavengers. Here the effects of sodium nitrate, an electron scavenger, are investigated at 100 K. For sodium nitrate at a concentration of 0.5 M in chicken egg-white lysozyme crystals, the dose tolerance is increased by a factor of two as judged from the global damage parameters, and no specific structural damage to the disulfide bonds is seen until the dose is greatly in excess (more than a factor of five) of the value at which damage appears in electron density maps derived from a scavenger-free crystal. In the electron density maps, ordered nitrate ions adjacent to the disulfide bonds are seen to lose an O atom, and appear to protect the disulfide bonds. In addition, results reinforcing previous reports on the effectiveness of ascorbate are presented. The mechanisms of action of both scavengers in the crystalline environment are elucidated. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {Turning commercial lab automation into a high-throughput centre requires an underlying process, and implementing checks to ensure that the process is working as it should. At the Collaborative Crystallisation Centre (C3), protein samples from local, national and international groups are set up in crystallisation screening and optimisation experiments with two thousand 96 well plates being set up each year. During its five years of operation, the C3 has implemented a series of enabling protocols - from simple 'reality checks' to determine if a screen has evaporated during storage to more sophisticated systems such as a sample labelling and tracking system. The most important - and perhaps surprising - lesson has been how much effort is required to effectively communicate between the centre and its clients, as well as between the centre's staff members. It is easy to confuse the concept of 'high throughput' in any field with the idea of setting up an experiment quickly. Although automation can be used to set up a single experiment more rapidly than can be done by hand, the distinguishing feature of a high throughput technology is the sustainability of the increased rate. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The most commonly used heavy-atom derivative, selenium, requires the use of a tunable beamline to access the Se K edge for experimental phasing using anomalous diffraction methods, whereas X-ray diffraction experiments for selenium-specific ultraviolet radiation-damage-induced phasing can be per-formed on fixed-wavelength beamlines or even using in-house X-ray sources. Several nonredundant X-ray diffraction data sets were collected from three different selenomethionine (Mse) derivatized protein crystals at energies far below the absorption edge before and after exposing the crystal to ultraviolet (UV) radiation using 266 nm lasers of flux density 1.7 1015 photons s -1 mm-2 for 10-50 min. A detailed analysis revealed that significant changes in diffracted intensities were induced by ultraviolet irradiation whilst retaining crystal isomorphism. These intensity changes allowed the crystal structures to be solved by the radiation-damage-induced phasing (RIP) technique. Inspection of the crystal structures and electron-density maps demonstrated that covalent bonds between selenium and carbon at all sites located in the core of the proteins or in a hydrophobic environment were much more susceptible to UV radiation-induced cleavage than other bonds typically present in Mse proteins. The rapid UV radiation-induced bond cleavage opens a reliable new paradigm for phasing when no tunable X-ray source is available. The behaviour of Mse derivatives of various proteins provides novel insights and an initial basis for understanding the mechanism of selenium-specific UV radiation damage. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {The temperature-dependence of radiation damage in macromolecular X-ray crystallography is currently much debated. Most protein crystallographic studies are based on data collected at 100 K. Data collection at temperatures below 100 K has been proposed to reduce radiation damage and above 100 K to be useful for kinetic crystallography that is aimed at the generation and trapping of protein intermediate states. Here the global and specific synchrotron-radiation sensitivity of crystalline thermolysin at 100 and 160 K are compared. Both types of damage are higher at 160 K than at 100 K. At 160 K more residue types are affected (Lys, Asp, Gln, Pro, Thr, Met, Asn) than at 100 K (Met, Asp, Glu, Lys). The X-ray-induced relative atomic B-factor increase is shown to correlate with the proximity of the atom to the nearest solvent channel at 160 K. Two models may explain the observed correlation: either an increase in static disorder or an increased attack of hydroxyl radicals from the solvent area of the crystal. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved.},

@article{Pellegrini2011,
abstract = {Over the last 20 years cryocrystallography has revolutionized the field of macromolecular crystallography, greatly reducing radiation damage and allowing the collection of complete data sets at synchrotron sources. However, in order to cool crystals to 100 K cryoprotective agents must usually be added to prevent the formation of crystalline ice, which disrupts the macromolecular crystal lattice and often results in a degradation of diffraction quality. This process can involve the extensive testing of solution compositions and soaking protocols to find suitable conditions that maintain diffraction quality. In this study, it is demonstrated that when some crystals of macromolecules are mounted in the complete absence of surrounding liquid no crystalline ice is formed and the diffraction resolution, merging R factors and mosaic spread values are comparable to those of crystals cryocooled in the presence of a cryoprotectant. This potentially removes one of the most onerous manual steps in the structure-solution pipeline and could alleviate some of the foreseen difficulties in the automation of crystal mounting. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Union of Crystallography.

abstract = {It is important to consider radiation damage to crystals caused by data collection when solving structures and critical when determining protein function, which can often depend on very subtle structural characteristics. In this study the rate of damage to specific sites in protein crystals cooled at 100 K is found to depend on the energy of the incident X-ray beam. Several lysozyme crystals were each subjected to 3-26 MGy of cumulative X-ray exposure by collecting multiple data sets from each crystal at either 9 keV or 14 keV. The integrated electron density surrounding each S atom in the structure was calculated for each data set and the change in electron density was evaluated as a function of dose at the two energies. The rate of electron density decrease per cubic {\AA} per MGy was determined to be greater at 14 keV than at 9 keV for cysteine sulfurs involved in disulphide bridges; no statistically significant differences in the decay rates were found for methionine sulfurs. These preliminary results imply that it might be possible to minimize certain types of specific radiation damage by an appropriate choice of energy. Further experiments studying a variety of photolabile sites over a wider range of energies are needed to confirm this conclusion. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved.},

In general the method works reliably, but it reaches its limits when the search model differs too much from the target structure in terms of coordinate deviations or completeness. Since anomalously scattering substructures are better con-served than the overall structure, these substructures and the corresponding anomalous intensity differences can be utilized to enhance the performance of molecular-replacement approaches. It is demonstrated that the combined and concomitant use of structure-factor amplitudes and anomalous differences constitutes a promising approach to push the limits of molecular replacement and to make more structures amenable to structure solution by this technique. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Union of Crystallography.},

@article{Sanishvili2011,
abstract = {Radiation damage is a major limitation in crystallography of biological macromolecules, even for cryocooled samples, and is particularly acute in microdiffraction. For the X-ray energies most commonly used for protein crystallography at synchrotron sources, photoelectrons are the predominant source of radiation damage. If the beam size is small relative to the photoelectron path length, then the photoelectron may escape the beam footprint, resulting in less damage in the illuminated volume. Thus, it may be possible to exploit this phenomenon to reduce radiation-induced damage during data measurement for techniques such as diffraction, spectroscopy, and imaging that use X-rays to probe both crystalline and noncrystalline biological samples. In a systematic and direct experimental demonstration of reduced radiation damage in protein crystals with small beams, damage was measured as a function of micron-sized X-ray beams of decreasing dimensions. The damage rate normalized for dose was reduced by a factor of three from the largest (15.6 $\mu$m) to the smallest (0.84 $\mu$m) X-ray beam used. Radiation-induced damage to protein crystals was also mapped parallel and perpendicular to the polarization direction of an incident 1-$\mu$m X-ray beam. Damage was greatest at the beam center and decreased monotonically to zero at a distance of about 4 $\mu$m, establishing the range of photoelectrons. The observed damage is less anisotropic than photoelectron emission probability, consistent with photoelectron trajectory simulations. These experimental results provide the basis for data collection protocols to mitigate with micron-sized X-ray beams the effects of radiation damage.},

abstract = {Recent studies have defined a data-collection protocol and a metric that provide a robust measure of global radiation damage to protein crystals. Using this protocol and metric, 19 small-molecule compounds (introduced either by cocrystalliz-ation or soaking) were evaluated for their ability to protect lysozyme crystals from radiation damage. The compounds were selected based upon their ability to interact with radiolytic products (e.g. hydrated electrons, hydrogen, hydroxyl and perhydroxyl radicals) and/or their efficacy in protecting biological molecules from radiation damage in dilute aqueous solutions. At room temperature, 12 compounds had no effect and six had a sensitizing effect on global damage. Only one compound, sodium nitrate, appeared to extend crystal lifetimes, but not in all proteins and only by a factor of two or less. No compound provided protection at T = 100 K. Scavengers are ineffective in protecting protein crystals from global damage because a large fraction of primary X-ray-induced excitations are generated in and/or directly attack the protein and because the ratio of scavenger molecules to protein molecules is too small to provide appreciable competitive protection. The same reactivity that makes some scavengers effective radioprotectors in protein solutions may explain their sensitizing effect in the protein-dense environment of a crystal. A more productive focus for future efforts may be to identify and eliminate sensitizing compounds from crystallization solutions. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Union of Crystallography.

abstract = {Microseed matrix-screening combined with random screens (rMMS) is a significant recent breakthrough in protein crystallization. In this study, a very reproducible assay for crystal seeds was set up that allowed the following recommendations to be made: (1) the suitability of a solution for suspending seed crystals can be predicted by incubating (uncrushed) crystals in it for one day and observing crystal stability. (2) For routine rMMS, seed crystals should be suspended in the crystallization cocktail that gave the original crystals. (3) Seed crystals can be suspended in PEG or NaCl solutions to reduce the prevalence of salt crystals. (4) Protein complexes can be seeded with seed crystals suspended in PEG. If necessary, seed crystals can also be suspended in the original crystallization cocktail with any individual ingredients that destabilize the complex removed.

abstract = {X-ray induced radiation damage of protein crystals is well known to occur even at cryogenic temperatures. Redox active sites like metal sites seem especially vulnerable for these radiation-induced reductions. It is essential to know correctly the oxidation state of metal sites in protein crystal structures to be able to interpret the structure-function relation. Through previous structural studies, we have tried to characterise and understand the reactions between myoglobin and peroxides. These reaction intermediates are relevant because myoglobin is proposed to take part as scavenger of reactive oxygen species during oxidative stress, and because these intermediates are similar among the haem peroxidases and oxygenases. We have in our previous studies shown that these different myoglobin states are influenced by the X-rays used. In this study, we have in detail investigated the impact that X-rays have on these different oxidation states of myoglobin. An underlying goal has been to find a way to be able to determine mostly unreduced states. We have by using single-crystal light absorption spectroscopy found that the different oxidation states of myoglobin are to a different extent influenced by the X-rays (e.g. ferric FeIII myoglobin is faster reduced than ferryl FeIVO myoglobin). We observe that the higher oxidation states are not reduced to normal ferrous FeII or ferric FeIII states, but end up in some intermediate and possibly artificial states. For ferric myoglobin, it seems that annealing of the radiation-induced/reduced state can reversibly more or less give the starting point (ferric myoglobin). Both scavengers and different dose-rates might influence to which extent the different states are affected by the X-rays. Our study shows that it is essential to do a time/dose monitoring of the influence X-rays have on each specific redox-state with spectroscopic techniques like single-crystal light absorption spectroscopy. This will determine to which extent you can collect X-ray diffraction data on your crystal before it becomes too heavily influenced/reduced by X-rays.

abstract = {Photosynthetic water oxidation and O 2 formation are catalyzed by a Mn 4Ca complex bound to the proteins of photosystem II (PSII). The catalytic site, including the inorganic Mn 4CaO nH x core and its protein environment, is denoted as oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). Earlier and recent progress in the endeavor to elucidate the structure of the OEC is reviewed, with focus on recent results obtained by (i) X-ray spectroscopy (specifically by EXAFS analyses), and (ii) X-ray diffraction (XRD, protein crystallography). Very recently, an impressive resolution of 1.9 {\AA} has been achieved by XRD. Most likely however, all XRD data on the Mn 4CaO nH x core of the OEC are affected by X-ray induced modifications (radiation damage). Therefore and to address (important) details of the geometric and electronic structure of the OEC, a combined analysis of XRD and XAS data has been approached by several research groups. These efforts are reviewed and extended using an especially comprehensive approach. Taking into account XRD results on the protein environment of the inorganic core of the Mn complex, 12 alternative OEC models are considered and evaluated by quantitative comparison to (i) extended-range EXAFS data, (ii) polarized EXAFS of partially oriented PSII membrane particles, and (iii) polarized EXAFS of PSII crystals. We conclude that there is a class of OEC models that is in good agreement with both the recent crystallographic models and the XAS data. On these grounds, mechanistic implications for the OO bond formation chemistry are discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Photosystem II. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The pH is one of the key parameters governing protein conformation and activity. In protein crystals, however, the pH is so far not accessible by experiment. Here, we report on the optical detection of the pH in a lysozyme crystal employing the pH-sensitive fluorescent dyes SNARF-1 and SNARF-4F. The molecular probes were loaded into the crystal by diffusion. Two-dimensional fluorescence spectra of the labeled protein crystal were recorded, and the average pH of the crystal at different bath pH's was determined by calibrating fluorescence peak ratios. In addition, we used two-photon microscopy to spatially resolve the pH inside a lysozyme crystal three-dimensionally and to follow pH changes in response to a pH change of the bath over time. At equilibrium at bath pH between 5.5 and 8.0, we found a pH in the water-filled crystal channels that was $\Delta$pH = -0.3 to -1.0 lower than that of the bath. This corresponds to a 2- to 10-fold higher proton concentration in the crystal channels than in the bath. The lower pH at equilibrium in the crystal channels can be explained by slower proton diff usion in the channels than in the bath and a resulting proton accumulation in the crystal for conservation of mass and so an equilibrium of proton flux. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

This is attributed to the ability to collect diffraction data before hydroxyl radicals can propagate through the crystal, fatally disrupting the lattice. Hydroxyl radicals are shown to be trapped in amorphous solutions at 100 K. The trend in crystal lifetime was observed in crystals of a soluble protein (immunoglobulin $\gamma$ Fc receptor IIIa), a virus (bovine enterovirus serotype 2) and a membrane protein (human A2A adenosine G-protein coupled receptor). The observation of a similar effect in all three systems provides clear evidence for a common optimal strategy for room-temperature data collection and will inform the design of future synchrotron beamlines and detectors for macro-molecular crystallography. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Union of Crystallography.

abstract = {X-ray radiation induces two main effects at metal centres contained in protein crystals: radiation-induced reduction and radiolysis and a resulting decrease in metal occupancy. In blue multicopper oxidases (BMCOs), the geometry of the active centres and the metal-to-ligand distances change depending on the oxidation states of the Cu atoms, suggesting that these alterations are catalytically relevant to the binding, activation and reduction of O2. In this work, the X-ray-determined three-dimensional structure of laccase from the basidiomycete Coriolopsis gallica (Cg L), a high catalytic potential BMCO, is described. By combining spectroscopic techniques (UV-Vis, EPR and XAS) and X-ray crystallography, structural changes at and around the active copper centres were related to pH and absorbed X - ray dose (energy deposited per unit mass). Depletion of two of the four active Cu atoms as well as low occupancies of the remaining Cu atoms, together with different conformations of the metal centres, were observed at both acidic pH and high absorbed dose, correlating with more reduced states of the active coppers. These observations provide additional evidence to support the role of flexibility of copper sites during O2 reduction. This study supports previous observations indicating that interpretations regarding redox state and metal coordination need to take radiation effects explicitly into account. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {Diffractionists usually place the birth of crystallography in 1912 with the first X-ray diffraction experiment of Friedrich, Knipping and Laue. This discovery propelled the mathematical branch of mineralogy to global importance and enabled crystal structure determination. Knowledge of the geometrical structure of matter at atomic resolution had revolutionary consequences for all branches of the natural sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, earth sciences and material science. It is scarcely possible for a single person in a single article to trace and appropriately value all of these developments. This article presents the limited, subjective view of its author and a limited selection of references. The bulk of the article covers the history of X-ray structure determination from the NaCl structure to aperiodic structures and macromolecular structures. The theoretical foundations were available by 1920. The subsequent success of crystallography was then due to the development of diffraction equipment, the theory of the solution of the phase problem, symmetry theory and computers. The many structures becoming known called for the development of crystal chemistry and of data banks. Diffuse scattering from disordered structures without and with partial long-range order allows determination of short-range order. Neutron and electron scattering and diffraction are also mentioned.},

The overall structure of EGFP is very similar to wt GFP, forming the classical $\beta$-barrel fold with the chromophore containing helix running through the core of the structure. Replacement of Phe64 with Leu in EGFP results in subtle rearrangement of hydrophobic core packing close to the chromophore including the reduction in surface exposure of two hydrophobic residues. Replacement of Ser65 with Thr has a significant impact on the local hydrogen bond network in the vicinity of the chromophore. Detailed analysis of electron density reveals that several residues close to the chromophore occupy at least two distinct conformations. This includes Glu222 that defines the charged state on the chromophore, with the two conformations having slightly different effects on the hydrogen bond network surrounding the chromophore. Hence, the reported high-resolution structure of EGFP has provided a long overdue molecular description of one of the most important fluorescent protein variants currently in general use. {\textcopyright} 2012 Arpino et al.},

abstract = {A Kunitz type dual inhibitor (TKI) of factor Xa (FXa) and trypsin was found in tamarind. It also shows prolongation of blood coagulation time. The deduced 185 amino acid sequence of TKI by cDNA cloning and sequence analysis revealed that it belongs to the Kunitz type soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) family; however, it has a distorted Kunitz signature sequence due to insertion of Asn15 in the motif. TKI exhibited a competitive inhibitory activity against both FXa (Ki = 220 nm) and porcine pancreatic trypsin (Ki = 3.2 nm). The crystal structure of TKI shows a $\beta$-trefoil fold similar to Kunitz STI inhibitors; however, a distinct mobile reactive site, an inserted residue and loop $\beta$7$\beta$8 make it distinct from classical Kunitz inhibitors. The crystal structure of TKI-trypsin and a 3D model of TKI-FXa complex revealed that the distinct reactive site loop probably plays a role in dual inhibition. The reactive site of TKI interacts with an active site and two exosites (36 loop and autolysis loop) of FXa. Apart from Arg66 (P1), Arg64 (P3) is one of the most important residues responsible for the specificity of TKI towards FXa. Along with the reactive site loop ($\beta$4$\beta$5), loops $\beta$1 and $\beta$7$\beta$8 also interact with FXa and could further confer selectivity for FXa. We also present the role of inserted Asn15 in the stabilization of complexes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first structure of FXa inhibitor belonging to the Kunitz type inhibitor family and its unique structural and sequence features make TKI a novel potent inhibitor. Database The complete nucleotide of TKI was deposited in the NCBI gene databank with accession no. HQ385502.

The XEOL of several proteins and their constituent amino acids has been characterized using the microspectrophotometers at the Swiss Light Source and Diamond Light Source. XEOL arises primarily from aromatic amino acids, but the effects of local environment and quenching within a crystal mean that the XEOL spectrum of a crystal is not the simple sum of the spectra of its constituent parts. Upon repeated exposure to X - rays XEOL spectra decay non-uniformly, suggesting that XEOL is sensitive to site-specific radiation damage.

abstract = {When crystallization screening is conducted many outcomes are observed but typically the only trial recorded in the literature is the condition that yielded the crystal(s) used for subsequent diffraction studies. The initial hit that was optimized and the results of all the other trials are lost. These missing results contain information that would be useful for an improved general understanding of crystallization. This paper provides a report of a crystallization data exchange (XDX) workshop organized by several international large-scale crystallization screening laboratories to discuss how this information may be captured and utilized. A group that administers a significant fraction of the worlds crystallization screening results was convened, together with chemical and structural data informaticians and computational scientists who specialize in creating and analysing large disparate data sets. The development of a crystallization ontology for the crystallization community was proposed. This paper (by the attendees of the workshop) provides the thoughts and rationale leading to this conclusion. This is brought to the attention of the wider audience of crystallographers so that they are aware of these early efforts and can contribute to the process going forward. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Union of Crystallography All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Most atomic-resolution protein structures are determined by growing protein crystals, then exposing them to intense X-ray beams. The pattern of scattered X-rays can be used to find the atomic structure of the protein. A major drawback of this technique is that absorbed X-rays damage the fragile protein crystals. We present a method for determining how long a protein crystal will last in the X-ray beam, and for evaluating specific data-collection strategies in terms of how many data are acquired per unit damage caused. By way of example, we show that a small change in the typical experimental geometry can allow large crystals to be exposed for longer, giving better data quality and resulting in lower levels of damage.},

abstract = {Molecular replacement is the method of choice for X-ray crystallographic structure determination provided that suitable structural homologues are available in the PDB. Presently, there are ∼80 000 structures in the PDB (8074 were deposited in the year 2012 alone), of which ∼70% have been solved by molecular replacement. For successful molecular replacement the model must cover at least 50% of the total structure and the C $\alpha$ r.m.s.d. between the core model and the structure to be solved must be less than 2 {\AA}. Here, an approach originally implemented in the CaspR server (http://www.igs.cnrs-mrs.fr/Caspr2/index.cgi) based on homology modelling to search for a molecular-replacement solution is discussed. How the use of as much information as possible from different sources can improve the model(s) is briefly described. The combination of structural information with distantly related sequences is crucial to optimize the multiple alignment that will define the boundaries of the core domains. PDB clusters (sequences with ≥30% identical residues) can also provide information on the eventual changes in conformation and will help to explore the relative orientations assumed by protein subdomains. Normal-mode analysis can also help in generating series of conformational models in the search for a molecular-replacement solution. Of course, finding a correct solution is only the first step and the accuracy of the identified solution is as important as the data quality to proceed through refinement. Here, some possible reasons for failure are discussed and solutions are proposed using a set of successful examples.},

abstract = {In an X-ray diffraction experiment, the structure of molecules and the crystal lattice changes owing to chemical reactions and physical processes induced by the absorption of X-ray photons. These structural changes alter structure factors, affecting the scaling and merging of data collected at different absorbed doses. Many crystallographic procedures rely on the analysis of consistency between symmetry-equivalent reflections, so failure to account for the drift of their intensities hinders the structure solution and the interpretation of structural results. The building of a conceptual model of radiation-induced changes in macromolecular crystals is the first step in the process of correcting for radiation-induced inconsistencies in diffraction data. Here the complexity of radiation-induced changes in real and reciprocal space is analysed using matrix singular value decomposition applied to multiple complete datasets obtained from single crystals. The model consists of a resolution-dependent decay correction and a uniform-per-unique-reflection term modelling specific radiation-induced changes. This model is typically sufficient to explain radiation-induced effects observed in diffraction intensities. This analysis will guide the parameterization of the model, enabling its use in subsequent crystallographic calculations.},

This diffraction-before- destruction approach requires a new crystal for each FEL shot and, since the crystals cannot be rotated during the X-ray pulse, data collection requires averaging over many different crystals and a Monte Carlo integration of the diffraction intensities, making the accurate determination of structure factors challenging. To investigate whether sufficient accuracy can be attained for the measurement of anomalous signal, a large data set was collected from lysozyme microcrystals at the newly established 'multi-purpose spectroscopy/imaging instrument' of the SPring-8 {\AA}ngstrom Compact Free-Electron Laser (SACLA) at RIKEN Harima. Anomalous difference density maps calculated from these data demonstrate that serial femtosecond crystallography using a free-electron laser is sufficiently accurate to measure even the very weak anomalous signal of naturally occurring S atoms in a protein at a photon energy of 7.3 keV. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved.},

The actual pH of the crystallization droplet is determined by the combined contribution of the buffers in the screening and protein solutions, although the contribution of the latter to the pH is often ignored. In this study, the effects of the buffer and protein solution pH values on the results of screening are systematically investigated. It was found that these parameters significantly affected the results and thus the following strategy for the selection of appropriate pH values is proposed: (i) when screening with only one protein solution, the pH should be as low, as high or as divergent from the pI as possible for a basic, acidic or neutral protein, respectively, within its stable pH range; (ii) when screening with two protein solutions, the pH values should be well separated from one another; and (iii) when multiple pH values are utilized, an even distribution of pH values is the best approach to increase the success rate of crystallization. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Union of Crystallography All rights reserved.},

Here, the dose has been fractioned and exposure series have been acquired in order to study beam-induced specimen movements under low dose conditions, prior to bubbling. Gold particles were added to the protein sample as fiducial markers. These were automatically localized and tracked throughout the exposure series and showed correlated motions within small patches, with larger amplitudes of motion vectors at the start of a series compared with the end of each series. A non-rigid scheme was used to register all images within each exposure series, using natural neighbor interpolation with the gold particles as anchor points.

abstract = {The `phase problem' in crystallography results from the inability to directly measure the phases of individual diffracted X-ray waves. While intensities are directly measured during data collection, phases must be obtained by other means. Several phasing methods are available (MIR, SAR, MAD, SAD and MR) and they all rely on the premise that phase information can be obtained if the positions of marker atoms in the unknown crystal structure are known. This paper is dedicated to the most popular phasing method, molecular replacement (MR), and represents a personal overview of the development, use and requirements of the methodology. The first description of noncrystallographic symmetry as a tool for structure determination was explained by Rossmann and Blow [Rossmann & Blow (1962), Acta Cryst. 15 , 24–31]. The term `molecular replacement' was introduced as the name of a book in which the early papers were collected and briefly reviewed [Rossmann (1972), The Molecular Replacement Method. New York: Gordon & Breach]. Several programs have evolved from the original concept to allow faster and more sophisticated searches, including six-dimensional searches and brute-force approaches. While careful selection of the resolution range for the search and the quality of the data will greatly influence the outcome, the correct choice of the search model is probably still the main criterion to guarantee success in solving a structure using MR. Two of the main parameters used to define the `best' search model are sequence identity (25% or more) and structural similarity. Another parameter that may often be undervalued is the quality of the probe: there is clearly a relationship between the quality and the correctness of the chosen probe and its usefulness as a search model. Efforts should be made by all structural biologists to ensure that their deposited structures, which are potential search probes for future systems, are of the best possible quality.},

abstract = {The availability of intense microbeam macromolecular crystallography beamlines at third-generation synchrotron sources has enabled data collection and structure solution from microcrystals of <10 $\mu$m in size. The increased likelihood of severe radiation damage where microcrystals or particularly sensitive crystals are used forces crystallographers to acquire large numbers of data sets from many crystals of the same protein structure. The associated analysis and merging of multi-crystal data is currently a manual and time-consuming step. Here, a computer program, BLEND, that has been written to assist with and automate many of the steps in this process is described. It is demonstrated how BLEND has successfully been used in the solution of a novel membrane protein. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Union of Crystallography.},

@article{Allan2013,
abstract = {An extensive radiation chemistry literature would suggest that the addition of certain radical scavengers might mitigate the effects of radiation damage during protein crystallography diffraction data collection. However, attempts to demonstrate and quantify such an amelioration and its dose dependence have not yielded consistent results, either at room temperature (RT) or 100 K. Here the information thus far available is summarized and reasons for this lack of quantitative success are identified. Firstly, several different metrics have been used to monitor and quantify the rate of damage, and, as shown here, these can give results which are in conflict regarding scavenger efficacy. In addition, significant variation in results from data collected from crystals treated in nominally the same way has been observed. Secondly, typical crystallization conditions contain substantial concentrations of chemical species which already interact strongly with some of the X-ray-induced radicals that the added scavengers are intended to intercept. These interactions are probed here by the complementary technique of on-line microspectrophotometry carried out on solutions and crystals held both at 100 K and RT, the latter enabled by the use of a beamline-mounted humidifying device. With the help of computational chemistry, attempts are made to assign some of the characteristic spectral features observed experimentally. A further source of uncertainty undoubtedly lies in the challenge of reliably measuring the parameters necessary for the accurate calculation of the absorbed dose ( e.g. crystal size and shape, beam profile) and its distribution within the volume of the crystal (an issue addressed in detail in another article in this issue). While microspectrophotometry reveals that the production of various species can be quenched by the addition of scavengers, it is less clear that this observation can be translated into a significant gain in crystal dose tolerance for macromolecular crystallographers.},

The radiation sensitivity shows a transition near 200 K, above which it appears to be limited by solvent-coupled diffusive processes. Consistent with this interpretation, a component of global damage proceeds on timescales of several minutes at 180 K, decreasing to seconds near room temperature. As a result, data collection times of order 1 s allow up to half of global damage to be outrun at 260 K. Much larger damage reductions near room temperature should be feasible using larger dose rates delivered using microfocused beams, enabling a significant expansion of structural studies of proteins under more nearly native conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore-all rights reserved.},

@article{Liebschner2013,
abstract = {Structural studies of proteins usually rely on a model obtained from one crystal. By investigating the details of this model, crystallographers seek to obtain insight into the function of the macromolecule. It is therefore important to know which details of a protein structure are reproducible or to what extent they might differ. To address this question, the high-resolution structures of five crystals of bovine trypsin obtained under analogous conditions were compared. Global parameters and structural details were investigated. All of the models were of similar quality and the pairwise merged intensities had large correlation coefficients. The C$\alpha$ and backbone atoms of the structures superposed very well. The occupancy of ligands in regions of low thermal motion was reproducible, whereas solvent molecules containing heavier atoms (such as sulfur) or those located on the surface could differ significantly. The coordination lengths of the calcium ion were conserved. A large proportion of the multiple conformations refined to similar occupancies and the residues adopted similar orientations. More than three quarters of the water-molecule sites were conserved within 0.5 {\AA} and more than one third were conserved within 0.1 {\AA}. An investigation of the protonation states of histidine residues and carboxylate moieties was consistent for all of the models. Radiation-damage effects to disulfide bridges were observed for the same residues and to similar extents. Main-chain bond lengths and angles averaged to similar values and were in agreement with the Engh and Huber targets. Other features, such as peptide flips and the double conformation of the inhibitor molecule, were also reproducible in all of the trypsin structures. Therefore, many details are similar in models obtained from different crystals. However, several features of residues or ligands located in flexible parts of the macromolecule may vary significantly, such as side-chain orientations and the occupancies of certain fragments. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Union of Crystallography.},

abstract = {Background: Expression and purification of correctly folded proteins typically require screening of different parameters such as protein variants, solubility enhancing tags or expression hosts. Parallel vector series that cover all variations are available, but not without compromise. We have established a fast, efficient and absolutely background free cloning approach that can be applied to any selected vector.Results: Here we describe a method to tailor selected expression vectors for parallel Sequence and Ligation Independent Cloning. SLIC cloning enables precise and sequence independent engineering and is based on joining vector and insert with 15-25 bp homologies on both DNA ends by homologous recombination. We modified expression vectors based on pET, pFastBac and pTT backbones for parallel PCR-based cloning and screening in E.coli, insect cells and HEK293E cells, respectively. We introduced the toxic ccdB gene under control of a strong constitutive promoter for counterselection of insert less vector. In contrast to DpnI treatment commonly used to reduce vector background, ccdB used in our vector series is 100% efficient in killing parental vector carrying cells and reduces vector background to zero. In addition, the 3' end of ccdB functions as a primer binding site common to all vectors. The second shared primer binding site is provided by a HRV 3C protease cleavage site located downstream of purification and solubility enhancing tags for tag removal. We have so far generated more than 30 different parallel expression vectors, and successfully cloned and expressed more than 250 genes with this vector series. There is no size restriction for gene insertion, clone efficiency is > 95% with clone numbers up to 200. The procedure is simple, fast, efficient and cost-effective. All expression vectors showed efficient expression of eGFP and different target proteins requested to be produced and purified at our Core Facility services.Conclusion: This new expression vector series allows efficient and cost-effective parallel cloning and thus screening of different protein constructs, tags and expression hosts. {\textcopyright} 2013 Scholz et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {X-ray data collection for macromolecular crystallography can lead to highly inhomogeneous distributions of dose within the crystal volume for cases when the crystal is larger than the beam or when the beam is non-uniform (Gaussian-like), particularly when crystal rotation is fully taken into account. Here the spatial distribution of dose is quantitatively modelled in order to compare the effectiveness of two dose-spreading data-collection protocols: helical scanning and translational collection. Their effectiveness in reducing the peak dose per unit diffraction is investigated via simulations for four common crystal shapes (cube, plate, long and short needles) and beams with a wide range of full width half maximum values. By inspection of the chosen metric, it is concluded that the optimum strategy is always to use as flat (top-hat) a beam as possible and to either match the beam size in both dimensions to the crystal, or to perform a helical scan with a beam which is narrow along the rotation axis and matched to the crystal size along the perpendicular axis. For crystal shapes where this is not possible, the reduction in peak dose per unit diffraction achieved through dose spreading is quantified and tabulated as a reference for experimenters.},

The major difficulty in obtaining NO-ligated Hbs is most likely to be related to the oxidative denitrosylation caused by the high reactivity of the nitrosylated species with O2. Here, using Raman-assisted X-ray crystallography, it is shown that under X-ray exposure (at four different radiation doses) crystals of nitrosylated haemoglobin from Trematomus bernacchii undergo a transition, mainly in the Β chains, that generates a pentacoordinate species owing to photodissociation of the Fe - NO bond. These data provide a physical explanation for the low number of nitrosylated Hb structures available in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {Reported here are measurements of the penetration depth and spatial distribution of photoelectron (PE) damage excited by 18.6 keV X-ray photons in a lysozyme crystal with a vertical submicrometre line-focus beam of 0.7 $\mu$m full-width half-maximum (FWHM). The experimental results determined that the penetration depth of PEs is 5 ± 0.5 $\mu$m with a monotonically decreasing spatial distribution shape, resulting in mitigation of diffraction signal damage. This does not agree with previous theoretical predication that the mitigation of damage requires a peak of damage outside the focus. A new improved calculation provides some qualitative agreement with the experimental results, but significant errors still remain. The mitigation of radiation damage by line focusing was measured experimentally by comparing the damage in the X-ray-irradiated regions of the submicrometre focus with the large-beam case under conditions of equal exposure and equal volumes of the protein crystal, and a mitigation factor of 4.4 ± 0.4 was determined. The mitigation of radiation damage is caused by spatial separation of the dominant PE radiation-damage component from the crystal region of the line-focus beam that contributes the diffraction signal. The diffraction signal is generated by coherent scattering of incident X-rays (which introduces no damage), while the overwhelming proportion of damage is caused by PE emission as X-ray photons are absorbed. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Union of Crystallography.},

This led, through his phasing and solving large mineral structures (without use of a computer), to work on metals, proteins, bubble rafts and his X-ray microscope. The relationship of this to early X-ray microdiffraction is outlined, followed by a brief review of electron microdiffraction methods, where electron-probe sizes smaller than one unit cell can be formed with an interesting failure of Braggs law. We end with a review of recent femtosecond X-ray snapshot diffraction from protein nanocrystals, using an X-ray laser which generates pulses so short that they terminate before radiation damage can commence, yet subsequently destroy the sample. In this way, using short pulses instead of freezing, the nexus between dose, resolution and crystal size has been broken, opening the way to time-resolved diffraction without damage for a stream of identical particles.},

In this paper, an overview of the use of Rosetta for these difficult molecular-replacement problems is provided and new modeling developments that further improve model quality are described. Several variations to the method are introduced that significantly reduce the time needed to generate a model and the sampling required to improve the starting template.

abstract = {Many bioscience fields employ high-throughput methods to screen multiple biochemical conditions. The analysis of these becomes tedious without a degree of automation. Crystallization, a rate limiting step in biological X-ray crystallography, is one of these fields. Screening of multiple potential crystallization conditions (cocktails) is the most effective method of probing a proteins phase diagram and guiding crystallization but the interpretation of results can be time-consuming. To aid this empirical approach a cocktail distance coefficient was developed to quantitatively compare macromolecule crystallization conditions and outcome. These coefficients were evaluated against an existing similarity metric developed for crystallization, the C6 metric, using both virtual crystallization screens and by comparison of two related 1,536-cocktail high-throughput crystallization screens. Hierarchical clustering was employed to visualize one of these screens and the crystallization results from an exopolyphosphatase-related protein from Bacteroides fragilis, (BfR192) overlaid on this clustering. This demonstrated a strong correlation between certain chemically related clusters and crystal lead conditions. While this analysis was not used to guide the initial crystallization optimization, it led to the re-evaluation of unexplained peaks in the electron density map of the protein and to the insertion and correct placement of sodium, potassium and phosphate atoms in the structure. With these in place, the resulting structure of the putative active site demonstrated features consistent with active sites of other phosphatases which are involved in binding the phosphoryl moieties of nucleotide triphosphates. The new distance coefficient, CDcoeff, appears to be robust in this application, and coupled with hierarchical clustering and the overlay of crystallization outcome, reveals information of biological relevance. While tested with a single example the potential applications related to crystallography appear promising and the distance coefficient, clustering, and hierarchal visualization of results undoubtedly have applications in wider fields. {\textcopyright} 2014 Bruno et al.},

In this strategy, the seed crystals are transferred into conditions unrelated to the seed source. Examples of MMS applications from in-house projects and the literature include the generation of multiple crystal forms and different space groups, better diffracting crystals and crystallization of previously uncrystallizable targets. MMS can be implemented robotically, making it a viable option for drug-discovery programs.

abstract = {X-ray-radiation-induced alterations to protein structures are still a severe problem in macromolecular crystallography. One way to avoid the influence of radiation damage is to reduce the X-ray dose absorbed by the crystal during data collection. However, here it is demonstrated using the example of the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR) that even a low dose of less than 0.06 MGy may induce structural alterations in proteins. This dose is about 500 times smaller than the experimental dose limit which should ideally not be exceeded per data set ( i.e. 30 MGy) and 20 times smaller than previously detected specific radiation damage at the bR active site. To date, it is the lowest dose at which radiation modification of a protein structure has been described. Complementary use was made of high-resolution X-ray crystallography and online microspectrophotometry to quantitatively study low-dose X-ray-induced changes. It is shown that structural changes of the protein correlate with the spectroscopically observed formation of the so-called bR orange species. Evidence is provided for structural modifications taking place at the protein active site that should be taken into account in crystallographic studies which aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of bR function.},

@article{Gallat2014,
abstract = {The serendipitous discovery of the spontaneous growth of protein crystals inside cells has opened the field of crystallography to chemically unmodified samples directly available from their natural environment. On the one hand, through in vivo crystallography, protocols for protein crystal preparation can be highly simplified, although the technique suffers from difficulties in sampling, particularly in the extraction of the crystals from the cells partly due to their small sizes. On the other hand, the extremely intense X-ray pulses emerging from X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) sources, along with the appearance of serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) is a milestone for radiation damage-free protein structural studies but requires micrometre-size crystals. The combination of SFX with in vivo crystallography has the potential to boost the applicability of these techniques, eventually bringing the field to the point where in vitro sample manipulations will no longer be required, and direct imaging of the crystals from within the cells will be achievable. To fully appreciate the diverse aspects of sample characterization, handling and analysis, SFX experiments at the Japanese SPring-8 angstrom compact free-electron laser were scheduled on various types of in vivo grown crystals. The first experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of the approach and suggest that future in vivo crystallography applications at XFELs will be another alternative to nano-crystallography.},

abstract = {The visual inspection of crystallization experiments is an important yet time-consuming and subjective step in X-ray crystallography. Previously published studies have focused on automatically classifying crystallization droplets into distinct but ultimately arbitrary experiment outcomes; here, a method is described that instead ranks droplets by their likelihood of containing crystals or microcrystals, thereby prioritizing for visual inspection those images that are most likely to contain useful information. The use of textons is introduced to describe crystallization droplets objectively, allowing them to be scored with the posterior probability of a random forest classifier trained against droplets manually annotated for the presence or absence of crystals or microcrystals. Unlike multi-class classification, this two-class system lends itself naturally to unidirectional ranking, which is most useful for assisting sequential viewing because images can be arranged simply by using these scores: this places droplets with probable crystalline behaviour early in the viewing order. Using this approach, the top ten wells included at least one human-annotated crystal or microcrystal for 94% of the plates in a data set of 196 plates imaged with a Minstrel HT system. The algorithm is robustly transferable to at least one other imaging system: when the parameters trained from Minstrel HT images are applied to a data set imaged by the Rock Imager system, human-annotated crystals ranked in the top ten wells for 90% of the plates. Because rearranging images is fundamental to the approach, a custom viewer was written to seamlessly support such ranked viewing, along with another important output of the algorithm, namely the shape of the curve of scores, which is itself a useful overview of the behaviour of the plate; additional features with known usefulness were adopted from existing viewers. Evidence is presented that such ranked viewing of images allows faster but more accurate evaluation of drops, in particular for the identification of microcrystals.},

The REMARK280 field is optional and currently uncurated, so significant effort needs to be applied to extract reliable data. There are well over 15 000 crystallization conditions available commercially from 12 different vendors. After putting the PDB crystallization information and the commercial cocktail data into a consistent format, these data are used to extract information about the overlap between the two sets of crystallization conditions. An estimation is made as to which commercially available conditions are most appropriate for producing well diffracting crystals by looking at which commercial conditions are found unchanged (or almost unchanged) in the PDB. Further analyses include which commercial kits are the most appropriate for shotgun or more traditional approaches to crystallization screening. This analysis suggests that almost 40% of the crystallization conditions found currently in the PDB are identical or very similar to a commercial condition.},

@article{Warkentin2014,
abstract = {All evidence to date indicates that at T = 100 K all protein crystals exhibit comparable sensitivity to X-ray damage when quantified using global metrics such as change in scaling B factor or integrated intensity versus dose. This is consistent with observations in cryo-electron microscopy, and results because nearly all diffusive motions of protein and solvent, including motions induced by radiation damage, are frozen out. But how do the sensitivities of different proteins compare at room temperature, where radiation-induced radicals are free to diffuse and protein and lattice structures are free to relax in response to local damage? It might be expected that a large complex with extensive conformational degrees of freedom would be more radiation sensitive than a small, compact globular protein. As a test case, the radiation sensitivity of 70S ribosome crystals has been examined. At T = 100 and 300 K, the half doses are 64 MGy (at 3 {\AA} resolution) and 150 kGy (at 5 {\AA} resolution), respectively. The maximum tolerable dose in a crystallography experiment depends upon the initial or desired resolution. When differences in initial data-set resolution are accounted for, the former half dose is roughly consistent with that for model proteins, and the 100/300 K half-dose ratio is roughly a factor of ten larger. 70S ribosome crystals exhibit substantially increased resolution at 100 K relative to 300 K owing to cooling-induced ordering and not to reduced radiation sensitivity and slower radiation damage.},

@article{Dauter2014,
abstract = {Whereas the vast majority of the more than 85 000 crystal structures of macromolecules currently deposited in the Protein Data Bank are of high quality, some suffer from a variety of imperfections. Although this fact has been pointed out in the past, it is still worth periodic updates so that the metadata obtained by global analysis of the available crystal structures, as well as the utilization of the individual structures for tasks such as drug design, should be based on only the most reliable data. Here, selected abnormal deposited structures have been analysed based on the Bayesian reasoning that the correctness of a model must be judged against both the primary evidence as well as prior knowledge. These structures, as well as information gained from the corresponding publications (if available), have emphasized some of the most prevalent types of common problems. The errors are often perfect illustrations of the nature of human cognition, which is frequently influenced by preconceptions that may lead to fanciful results in the absence of proper validation. Common errors can be traced to negligence and a lack of rigorous verification of the models against electron density, creation of non-parsimonious models, generation of improbable numbers, application of incorrect symmetry, illogical presentation of the results, or violation of the rules of chemistry and physics. Paying more attention to such problems, not only in the final validation stages but during the structure-determination process as well, is necessary not only in order to maintain the highest possible quality of the structural repositories and databases but most of all to provide a solid basis for subsequent studies, including large-scale data-mining projects. For many scientists PDB deposition is a rather infrequent event, so the need for proper training and supervision is emphasized, as well as the need for constant alertness of reason and critical judgment as absolutely necessary safeguarding measures against such problems. Ways of identifying more problematic structures are suggested so that their users may be properly alerted to their possible shortcomings.},

As an example, we describe the immunoprecipitation of GFP-tagged proteins from Drosophila melanogaster larval extracts that are homologous to proteins implicated in human diseases, followed by western blotting to examine student experimental outcomes. However, the widespread availability of GFP-fusion proteins in diverse organisms enables researchers to tailor the second part of the course to their specific research programs while maintaining the flexibility to engage students in active learning.

@article{Stellato2014,
abstract = {A new approach for collecting data from many hundreds of thousands of microcrystals using X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser has recently been developed. Referred to as serial crystallography, diffraction patterns are recorded at a constant rate as a suspension of protein crystals flows across the path of an X-ray beam. Events that by chance contain single-crystal diffraction patterns are retained, then indexed and merged to form a three-dimensional set of reflection intensities for structure determination. This approach relies upon several innovations: an intense X-ray beam; a fast detector system; a means to rapidly flow a suspension of crystals across the X-ray beam; and the computational infrastructure to process the large volume of data. Originally conceived for radiation-damage-free measurements with ultrafast X-ray pulses, the same methods can be employed with synchrotron radiation. As in powder diffraction, the averaging of thousands of observations per Bragg peak may improve the ratio of signal to noise of low-dose exposures. Here, it is shown that this paradigm can be implemented for room-temperature data collection using synchrotron radiation and exposure times of less than 3 ms. Using lysozyme microcrystals as a model system, over 40 000 single-crystal diffraction patterns were obtained and merged to produce a structural model that could be refined to 2.1 {\AA} resolution. The resulting electron density is in excellent agreement with that obtained using standard X-ray data collection techniques. With further improvements the method is well suited for even shorter exposures at future and upgraded synchrotron radiation facilities that may deliver beams with 1000 times higher brightness than they currently produce.},

abstract = {Using synchrotron radiation (SR), the crystal structures of T6 bovine insulin complexed with Ni2+ and Cu2+ were solved to 1.50 and 1.45 {\AA} resolution, respectively. The level of detail around the metal centres in these structures was highly limited, and the coordination of water in Cu site II of the copper insulin derivative was deteriorated as a consequence of radiation damage. To provide more detail, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was used to improve the information level about metal coordination in each derivative. The nickel derivative contains hexacoordinated Ni2+ with trigonal symmetry, whereas the copper derivative contains tetragonally distorted hexacoordinated Cu2+ as a result of the Jahn-Teller effect, with a significantly longer coordination distance for one of the three water molecules in the coordination sphere. That the copper centre is of type II was further confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The coordination distances were refined from EXAFS with standard deviations within 0.01 {\AA}. The insulin derivative containing Cu2+ is sensitive towards photoreduction when exposed to SR. During the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+, the coordination geometry of copper changes towards lower coordination numbers. Primary damage, i.e. photoreduction, was followed directly by XANES as a function of radiation dose, while secondary damage in the form of structural changes around the Cu atoms after exposure to different radiation doses was studied by crystallography using a laboratory diffractometer. Protection against photoreduction and subsequent radiation damage was carried out by solid embedment of Cu insulin in a saccharose matrix. At 100 K the photoreduction was suppressed by ∼15%, and it was suppressed by a further ∼30% on cooling the samples to 20 K. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Union of Crystallography.},

abstract = {Radiation damage impedes macromolecular diffraction experiments. Alongside the well known effects of global radiation damage, site-specific radiation damage affects data quality and the veracity of biological conclusions on protein mechanism and function. Site-specific radiation damage follows a relatively predetermined pattern, in that different structural motifs are affected at different dose regimes: in metal-free proteins, disulfide bonds tend to break first followed by the decarboxylation of aspartic and glutamic acids. Even within these damage motifs the decay does not progress uniformly at equal rates. Within the same protein, radiation-induced electron density decay of a particular chemical group is faster than for the same group elsewhere in the protein: an effect known as preferential specific damage. Here, B Damage , a new atomic metric, is defined and validated to recognize protein regions susceptible to specific damage and to quantify the damage at these sites. By applying B Damage to a large set of known protein structures in a statistical survey, correlations between the rates of damage and various physicochemical parameters were identified. Results indicate that specific radiation damage is independent of secondary protein structure. Different disulfide bond groups (spiral, hook, and staple) show dissimilar radiation damage susceptibility. There is a consistent positive correlation between specific damage and solvent accessibility.},

abstract = {Radiation damage is an unavoidable obstacle in X-ray crystallographic data collection for macromolecular structure determination, so it is important to know how much radiation a sample can endure before being degraded beyond an acceptable limit. In the literature, the threshold at which the average intensity of all recorded reflections decreases to a certain fraction of the initial value is called the `dose limit'. The first estimated D 50 dose-limit value, at which the average diffracted intensity was reduced to 50%, was 20 MGy and was derived from observing sample decay in electron-diffraction experiments. A later X-ray study carried out at 100 K on ferritin protein crystals arrived at a D 50 of 43 MGy, and recommended an intensity reduction of protein reflections to 70%, D 70 , corresponding to an absorbed dose of 30 MGy, as a more appropriate limit for macromolecular crystallography. In the macromolecular crystallography community, the rate of intensity decay with dose was then assumed to be similar for all protein crystals. A series of diffraction images of cryocooled (100 K) thaumatin crystals at identical small, 2° rotation intervals were recorded at X-ray energies of 6.33 , 12.66 and 19.00 keV. Five crystals were used for each wavelength. The decay in the average diffraction intensity to 70% of the initial value, for data extending to 2.45 {\AA} resolution, was determined to be about 7.5 MGy at 6.33 keV and about 11 MGy at the two higher energies.},

The temperature at which the protein and precipitant solutions are mixed (i.e., the ambient temperature during mixing) is such a parameter that is typically not well controlled and is often ignored. In this paper, we show that this temperature can influence protein crystallization. The experimental results showed that both higher and lower mixing temperatures can enhance the success of crystallization, which follows a parabolic curve with an increasing ambient temperature. This work illustrates that the crystallization solution preparation temperature is also an important parameter for protein crystallization. Uncontrolled or poorly controlled room temperature may yield poor reproducibility in protein crystallization.},

abstract = {Serial crystallography, using either femtosecond X-ray pulses from free-electron laser sources or short synchrotron-radiation exposures, has the potential to reveal metalloprotein structural details while minimizing damage processes. However, deriving a self-consistent set of Bragg intensities from numerous still-crystal exposures remains a difficult problem, with optimal protocols likely to be quite different from those well established for rotation photography. Here several data processing issues unique to serial crystallography are examined. It is found that the limiting resolution differs for each shot, an effect that is likely to be due to both the sample heterogeneity and pulse-to-pulse variation in experimental conditions. Shots with lower resolution limits produce lower-quality models for predicting Bragg spot positions during the integration step. Also, still shots by their nature record only partial measurements of the Bragg intensity. An approximate model that corrects to the full-spot equivalent (with the simplifying assumption that the X-rays are monochromatic) brings the distribution of intensities closer to that expected from an ideal crystal, and improves the sharpness of anomalous difference Fourier peaks indicating metal positions.},

SFX requires a steady supply of microcrystals intersecting the XFEL beam at random orientations. An LCP–SFX method has recently been introduced in which microcrystals of membrane proteins are grown and delivered for SFX data collection inside a gel-like membrane-mimetic matrix, known as lipidic cubic phase (LCP), using a special LCP microextrusion injector. Here, it is demonstrated that LCP can also be used as a suitable carrier medium for microcrystals of soluble proteins, enabling a dramatic reduction in the amount of crystallized protein required for data collection compared with crystals delivered by liquid injectors. High-quality LCP–SFX data sets were collected for two soluble proteins, lysozyme and phycocyanin, using less than 0.1 mg of each protein.},

abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers have enabled femtosecond protein nanocrystallography, a novel method to determine the structure of proteins. It allows time-resolved imaging of nanocrystals that are too small for conventional crystallography. The short pulse duration helps in overcoming the detrimental effects of radiation damage because x rays are scattered before the sample has been significantly altered. It has been suggested that, fortuitously, the diffraction process self-terminates abruptly once radiation damage destroys the crystalline order. Our calculations show that high-intensity x-ray pulses indeed trigger a cascade of damage processes in ferredoxin crystals, a particular metalloprotein of interest. However, we found that the damage process is initially not completely random. Correlations exist among the protein monomers, so that Bragg diffraction still occurs in the damaged crystals, despite significant atomic displacements. Our results show that the damage process is reproducible to a certain degree, which is potentially beneficial for the orientation step in single-molecule imaging.},

However, several crystallographic "artifacts," including conformational selection, crystallization conditions and radiation damages, may affect the quality and the interpretation of the electron density maps, thus limiting the relevance of structure determinations. Moreover, for most of these structures, no functional data have been obtained in the crystalline state, thus posing serious questions on their validity in infereing protein mechanisms. In order to solve these issues, spectroscopic methods have been applied for the determination of equilibrium and kinetic properties of proteins in the crystalline state. These methods are UV-vis spectrophotometry, spectrofluorimetry, IR, EPR, Raman, and resonance Raman spectroscopy. Some of these approaches have been implemented with on-line instruments at X-ray synchrotron beamlines. Here, we provide an overview of investigations predominantly carried out in our laboratory by single crystal polarized absorption UV-vis microspectrophotometry, the most applied technique for the functional characterization of proteins in the crystalline state. Studies on hemoglobins, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate dependent enzymes and green fluorescent protein in the crystalline state have addressed key biological issues, leading to either straightforward structure-function correlations or limitations to structure-based mechanisms.},

Cryocooling of crystals should theoretically increase the fraction of occupied binding sites and decrease radiation damage. However, it might also perturb protein conformations that can be accessed at room temperature. Using data from crystals measured consecutively at room temperature and at cryogenic temperature, we found that transient binding sites could be abolished at the cryogenic temperatures employed by standard approaches. Changing the temperature at which the crystallographic data was collected could provide a deliberate perturbation to the equilibrium of protein conformations and help to visualize hidden sites with great potential to allosterically modulate protein function. Too cool to show up: The common practice of cryocooling crystals was found to mask transient protein conformations. Data collected on a single crystal revealed ligand binding to a cryptic site at room temperature that was hidden at cryogenic temperature. These results contradict thermodynamic expectations and provide a method for discovering allosteric sites with great potential for modulating protein (mal)-function.},

abstract = {Significant progress has been made in macromolecular crystallography over recent years in both the understanding and mitigation of X-ray induced radiation damage when collecting diffraction data from crystalline proteins. In contrast, despite the large field that is productively engaged in the study of radiation chemistry of nucleic acids, particularly of DNA, there are currently very few X-ray crystallographic studies on radiation damage mechanisms in nucleic acids. Quantitative comparison of damage to protein and DNA crystals separately is challenging, but many of the issues are circumvented by studying pre-formed biological nucleoprotein complexes where direct comparison of each component can be made under the same controlled conditions. Here a model protein–DNA complex C.Esp1396I is employed to investigate specific damage mechanisms for protein and DNA in a biologically relevant complex over a large dose range (2.07–44.63 MGy). In order to allow a quantitative analysis of radiation damage sites from a complex series of macromolecular diffraction data, a computational method has been developed that is generally applicable to the field. Typical specific damage was observed for both the protein on particular amino acids and for the DNA on, for example, the cleavage of base-sugar N 1 —C and sugar-phosphate C—O bonds. Strikingly the DNA component was determined to be far more resistant to specific damage than the protein for the investigated dose range. At low doses the protein was observed to be susceptible to radiation damage while the DNA was far more resistant, damage only being observed at significantly higher doses.},

abstract = {Recombinant enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) is used as a marker in numerous applications in biomedical research and diagnostics. For these applications, the macromolecule needs to be provided in a highly purified form. The conventional purification process of eGFP usually consists of multiple subsequent preparative chromatography steps. Since this procedure is costly and time-consuming, an alternative chromatography-free purification process was investigated. This process was a combination of three-phase partitioning (TPP) and preparative crystallization including an ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) intermediate step. After the TPP step, eGFP with a purity level suitable for preparative crystallization of 82.5-85.0% and a yield of 84-92% was obtained depending on the scale. After cross-flow UF/DF, the crystallization was performed in parallelized mL-scale stirred tanks. A favorable robust crystal morphology was obtained combined with fast crystallization kinetics when two polyethylenglycols and ethanol were used simultaneously as crystallization additives. The crystallization process can easily be scaled-up to obtain large amounts of highly purified, concentrated eGFP with a purity >99% after a crystal wash step and resolubilization. The proposed chromatography-free purification procedure gives reason to expect significant reductions of costs and required process time compared to conventional preparative chromatography.},

During the pulse, photoionization can reach the point of saturation in which certain atomic species in the sample lose most of their electrons. This electronic radiation damage causes the atomic scattering factors to change, affecting, in particular, the heavy atoms, due to their higher photoabsorption cross sections. Here, it is shown that experimental serial femtosecond crystallography data collected with an extremely bright XFEL source exhibit a reduction of the effective scattering power of the sulfur atoms in a native protein. Quantitative methods are developed to retrieve information on the effective ionization of the damaged atomic species from experimental data, and the implications of utilizing new phasing methods which can take advantage of this localized radiation damage are discussed.},

abstract = {Serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography of protein nanocrystals using ultrashort and intense pulses from an X-ray free-electron laser has proved to be a successful method for structural determination. However, due to significant variations in diffraction pattern quality from pulse to pulse only a fraction of the collected frames can be used. Experimentally, the X-ray temporal pulse profile is not known and can vary with every shot. This simulation study describes how the pulse shape affects the damage dynamics, which ultimately affects the biological interpretation of electron density. The instantaneously detected signal varies during the pulse exposure due to the pulse properties, as well as the structural and electronic changes in the sample. Here ionization and atomic motion are simulated using a radiation transfer plasma code. Pulses with parameters typical for X-ray free-electron lasers are considered: pulse energies ranging from 10 4 to 10 7 J cm −2 with photon energies from 2 to 12 keV, up to 100 fs long. Radiation damage in the form of sample heating that will lead to a loss of crystalline periodicity and changes in scattering factor due to electronic reconfigurations of ionized atoms are considered here. The simulations show differences in the dynamics of the radiation damage processes for different temporal pulse profiles and intensities, where ionization or atomic motion could be predominant. The different dynamics influence the recorded diffracted signal in any given resolution and will affect the subsequent structure determination.},

abstract = {Protein crystallography using synchrotron radiation sources has had a tremendous impact on biology, having yielded the structures of thousands of proteins and given detailed insight into their mechanisms. However, the technique is limited by the requirement for macroscopic crystals, which can be difficult to obtain, as well as by the often severe radiation damage caused in diffraction experiments, in particular when using tiny crystals. To slow radiation damage, data collection is typically performed at cryogenic temperatures. With the advent of free-electron lasers (FELs) capable of delivering extremely intense femtosecond X-ray pulses, this situation appears to be remedied, allowing the structure determination of undamaged macromolecules using either macroscopic or microscopic crystals. The latter are exposed to the FEL beam in random orientations and their diffraction data are collected at cryogenic or room temperature in a serial fashion, since each crystal is destroyed upon a single exposure. The new approaches required for crystal growth and delivery, and for diffraction data analysis, including de novo phasing, are reviewed. The opportunities and challenges of SFX are described, including applications such as time-resolved measurements and the analysis of radiation damage-prone systems.},

abstract = {We compare three schemes for time-resolved X-ray diffraction from protein nanocrystals using an X-ray free-electron laser. We find expressions for the errors in structure factor measurement using the Monte Carlo pump-probe method of data analysis with a liquid jet, the fixed sample pump-probe (goniometer) method (both diffract-and-destroy, and below the safe damage dose), and a proposed two-color method. Here, an optical pump pulse arrives between X-ray pulses of slightly different energies which hit the same nanocrystal, using a weak first X-ray pulse which does not damage the sample. (Radiation damage is outrun in the other cases.) This two-color method, in which separated Bragg spots are impressed on the same detector readout, eliminates stochastic fluctuations in crystal size, shape, and orientation and is found to require two orders of magnitude fewer diffraction patterns than the currently used Monte Carlo liquid jet method, for 1% accuracy. Expressions are given for errors in structure factor measurement for the four approaches, and detailed simulations provided for cathepsin B and IC3 crystals. While the error is independent of the number of shots for the dose-limited goniometer method, it falls offinversely as the square root of the number of shots for the two-color and Monte Carlo methods, with a much smaller pre-factor for the two-color mode, when the first shot is below the damage threshold.},

The extreme brightness of the XFEL radiation can multiply ionize most, if not all, atoms in a protein, causing their scattering factors to change during the pulse, with a preferential `bleaching' of heavy atoms. This paper investigates the effects of electronic damage on experimental data collected from a Gd derivative of lysozyme microcrystals at different X-ray intensities, and the degree of ionization of Gd atoms is quantified from phased difference Fourier maps.

@article{Wickstrand2015,
abstract = {Background Bacteriorhodopsin (bR) is the simplest known light driven proton pump and has been heavily studied using structural methods: eighty four X-ray diffraction, six electron diffraction and three NMR structures of bR are deposited within the protein data bank. Twenty one X-ray structures report light induced structural changes and changes induced by mutation, changes in pH, thermal annealing or X-ray induced photo-reduction have also been examined. Scope of review We argue that light-induced structural changes that are replicated across several studies by independent research groups are those most likely to represent what is happening in reality. We present both internal distance matrix analyses that sort deposited bR structures into hierarchal trees, and difference Fourier analysis of deposited X-ray diffraction data. Major conclusions An internal distance matrix analysis separates most wild-type bR structures according to their different crystal forms, indicating how the protein's structure is influenced by crystallization conditions. A similar analysis clusters eleven studies of illuminated bR crystals as one branch of a hierarchal tree with reproducible movements of the extracellular portion of helix C towards helix G, and of the cytoplasmic portion of helix F away from helices A, B and G. All crystallographic data deposited for illuminated crystals show negative difference density on a water molecule (Wat402) that forms H-bonds to the retinal Schiff Base and two aspartate residues (Asp85, Asp212) in the bR resting state. Other recurring difference density features indicated reproducible side-chain, backbone and water molecule displacements. X-ray induced radiation damage also disorders Wat402 but acts via cleaving the head-groups of Asp85 and Asp212. General significance A remarkable level of agreement exists when deposited structures and crystallographic observations are viewed as a whole. From this agreement a unified picture of the structural mechanism of light-induced proton pumping by bR emerges.

Obtaining this information at the appropriate length-scales however is extremely challenging. One approach that has been recently demonstrated as a promising avenue for characterizing the size and shape of protein crystals at nanometre length-scales is Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (BCDI). BCDI is a recently developed technique that is able to recover the phase of the continuous diffraction intensity signal around individual Bragg peaks. When data is collected at multiple points on a rocking curve, a reciprocal space map (RSM) can be assembled and then inverted using BCDI to obtain a three-dimensional image of the crystal. The first demonstration of two-dimensional biological BCDI was reported by Boutet et al on holoferritin, recently this work was extended to the study of radiation damage in micron-sized protein crystals. Here we present the first three-dimensional reconstructions of a Lysozyme protein crystal using BDI. The results are validated against RSM and transmission electron microscopy data and have implications for both radiation damage studies and for developing new approaches for structure retrieval from micron-sized protein crystals.},

abstract = {Many biochemical processes take place on timescales ranging from femtoseconds to seconds. Accordingly, any time-resolved experiment must be matched to the speed of the structural changes of interest. Therefore, the timescale of interest defines the requirements of the X-ray source, instrumentation and data-collection strategy. In this study, a minimalistic approach for in situ crystallization is presented that requires only a few microlitres of sample solution containing a few hundred crystals. It is demonstrated that complete diffraction data sets, merged from multiple crystals, can be recorded within only a few minutes of beamtime and allow high-resolution structural information of high quality to be obtained with a temporal resolution of 40 ms. Global and site-specific radiation damage can be avoided by limiting the maximal dose per crystal to 400 kGy. Moreover, analysis of the data collected at higher doses allows the time-resolved observation of site-specific radiation damage. Therefore, our approach is well suited to observe structural changes and possibly enzymatic reactions in the low-millisecond regime.},

However, one frequent problem is the sampling of unrealistic conformations, which may also lead to poor pK a predictions. To address this problem, we have developed and benchmarked the pH-titration MD (pHtMD) approach, which is inspired by wet-lab titration experiments. We give several examples how the pHtMD protocol can be applied for pK a calculation including peptide systems, Staphylococcus nuclease (SNase), and the chaperone HdeA. For HdeA, pHtMD is also capable of monitoring pH-dependent dimer dissociation in accordance with experiments. We conclude that pHtMD represents a versatile tool for pK a value calculation and simulation of pH-dependent effects in proteins.},

abstract = {The crystallographic diffraction experiment measures Bragg intensities; crystallographic electron-density maps and other crystallographic calculations in phasing require structure-factor amplitudes. If data were measured with no errors, the structure-factor amplitudes would be trivially proportional to the square roots of the intensities. When the experimental errors are large, and especially when random errors yield negative net intensities, the conversion of intensities and their error estimates into amplitudes and associated error estimates becomes nontrivial. Although this problem has been addressed intermittently in the history of crystallographic phasing, current approaches to accounting for experimental errors in macromolecular crystallography have numerous significant defects. These have been addressed with the formulation of LLGI, a log-likelihood-gain function in terms of the Bragg intensities and their associated experimental error estimates. LLGI has the correct asymptotic behaviour for data with large experimental error, appropriately downweighting these reflections without introducing bias. LLGI abrogates the need for the conversion of intensity data to amplitudes, which is usually performed with the French and Wilson method [French & Wilson (1978), Acta Cryst. A 35 , 517–525], wherever likelihood target functions are required. It has general applicability for a wide variety of algorithms in macromolecular crystallography, including scaling, characterizing anisotropy and translational noncrystallographic symmetry, detecting outliers, experimental phasing, molecular replacement and refinement. Because it is impossible to reliably recover the original intensity data from amplitudes, it is suggested that crystallographers should always deposit the intensity data in the Protein Data Bank.},

abstract = {Cross-linked protein crystals (CLPCs) are very useful materials in applications such as biosensors, catalysis, and X-ray crystallography. Hence, preparation of CLPCs is an important research direction. During the preparation of CLPCs, an often encountered problem is that cracks may appear in the crystals, which may finally lead to shattering of the crystals into small pieces and cause problem in practical applications. To avoid cross-link induced cracking, it is necessary to study the cracking phenomenon in the preparation process. In this paper, we present an investigation on how to avoid cracking during preparation of CLPCs. An orthogonal experiment was designed to study the phenomenon of cross-link induced cracking of hen-egg white lysozyme (HEWL) crystals against five parameters (temperature, solution pH, crystal growth time, glutaraldehyde concentration, and cross-linking time). The experimental results showed that, the solution pH and crystal growth time can significantly affect cross-link induced cracking. The possible mechanism was studied, and optimized conditions for obtaining crack-free CLPCs were obtained and experimentally verified.},

abstract = {Since Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) was first successfully expressed in heterologous systems in 1994, many genes encoding other natural autofluorescent proteins (AFPs) have been cloned and subsequently modified by protein engineering to improve their physicochemical properties. Throughout this twenty-two-year period, glycine 67 (Gly67) has been regarded as the only amino acid in the entire protein family that is essential for the formation of the different reported chromophores. In this work, we demonstrate that a synthetic gene encoding LanFP10-A, a natural protein encoded in the genome of the lancelet Branchiostoma floridae containing the G67A mutation, produces a heterologous, functional yellow fluorescent protein when expressed in E. coli. In contrast to LanFP10-A, LanFP6-A, a second GFP-like protein found in the lancelet genome that also contains the natural G67A mutation, was non-fluorescent.},

abstract = {Proteins belong to the most complex colloidal system in terms of their physicochemical properties, size and conformational-flexibility. This complexity contributes to their great sensitivity to any external change and dictate the uncertainty of crystallization. The need of 3D models to understand their functionality and interaction mechanisms with other neighbouring (macro)molecules has driven the tremendous effort put into the field of crystallography that has also permeated other fields trying to shed some light into reluctant-to-crystallize proteins. This review is aimed at revising protein crystallization from a regular-laboratory point of view. It is also devoted to highlight the latest developments and achievements to produce, identify and deliver high-quality protein crystals for XFEL, Micro-ED or neutron diffraction. The low likelihood of protein crystallization is rationalized by considering the intrinsic polypeptide nature (folded state, surface charge, etc) followed by a description of the standard crystallization methods (batch, vapour diffusion and counter-diffusion), including high throughput advances. Other methodologies aimed at determining protein features in solution (NMR, SAS, DLS) or to gather structural information from single particles such as Cryo-EM are also discussed. Finally, current approaches showing the convergence of different structural biology techniques and the cross-methodologies adaptation to tackle the most difficult problems, are presented. Synopsis Current advances in biomacromolecules crystallization, from nano crystals for XFEL and Micro-ED to large crystals for neutron diffraction, are covered with special emphasis in methodologies applicable at laboratory scale.},

abstract = {In X-ray crystallography, for the determination of the 3-D structure of macromolecules, radiation damage is still an inherent problem at modern third generation synchrotron sources, even when utilising cryo-crystallographic techniques (sample held at 100 K). At doses of just several MGy, at which a typical diffraction dataset is collected, site-specific radiation-induced chemical changes are known to manifest within protein crystals, and a wide body of literature is now devoted to understanding the mechanisms behind such damage. Far less is known regarding radiation-induced damage to crystalline nucleic acids and the wider class of nucleoprotein complexes during macromolecular X-ray crystallography (MX) data collection. As the MX structural biology community now strives to solve structures for increasingly larger and complex macromolecular assemblies, it essential to understand how such structures are affected by the X-ray radiation used to solve them. The purpose of this review is to summarise advances in the field of specific damage to nucleoprotein complexes and to present case studies of MX damage investigations on both protein-DNA (C.Esp1396I) and protein-RNA (TRAP) complexes. To motivate further investigations into MX damage mechanisms within nucleoprotein complexes, current and emerging protocols for investigating specific damage within Fobs(n)−Fobs(1) electron density difference maps are discussed.},

abstract = {Radiation damage during macromolecular X-ray crystallographic data collection is still the main impediment for many macromolecular structure determinations. Even when an eventual model results from the crystallographic pipeline, the manifestations of radiation-induced structural and conformation changes, the so-called specific damage, within crystalline macromolecules can lead to false interpretations of biological mechanisms. Although this has been well characterized within protein crystals, far less is known about specific damage effects within the larger class of nucleoprotein complexes. Here, a methodology has been developed whereby per-atom density changes could be quantified with increasing dose over a wide (1.3–25.0 MGy) range and at higher resolution (1.98 {\AA}) than the previous systematic specific damage study on a protein–DNA complex. Specific damage manifestations were determined within the large trp RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP) bound to a single-stranded RNA that forms a belt around the protein. Over a large dose range, the RNA was found to be far less susceptible to radiation-induced chemical changes than the protein. The availability of two TRAP molecules in the asymmetric unit, of which only one contained bound RNA, allowed a controlled investigation into the exact role of RNA binding in protein specific damage susceptibility. The 11-fold symmetry within each TRAP ring permitted statistically significant analysis of the Glu and Asp damage patterns, with RNA binding unexpectedly being observed to protect these otherwise highly sensitive residues within the 11 RNA-binding pockets distributed around the outside of the protein molecule. Additionally, the method enabled a quantification of the reduction in radiation-induced Lys and Phe disordering upon RNA binding directly from the electron density.},

abstract = {Relating individual protein crystal structures to an enzyme mechanism remains a major and challenging goal for structural biology. Serial crystallography using multiple crystals has recently been reported in both synchrotron-radiation and X-ray free-electron laser experiments. In this work, serial crystallography was used to obtain multiple structures serially from one crystal (MSOX) to study in crystallo enzyme catalysis. Rapid, shutterless X-ray detector technology on a synchrotron MX beamline was exploited to perform low-dose serial crystallography on a single copper nitrite reductase crystal, which survived long enough for 45 consecutive 100 K X-ray structures to be collected at 1.07–1.62 {\AA} resolution, all sampled from the same crystal volume. This serial crystallography approach revealed the gradual conversion of the substrate bound at the catalytic type 2 Cu centre from nitrite to nitric oxide, following reduction of the type 1 Cu electron-transfer centre by X-ray-generated solvated electrons. Significant, well defined structural rearrangements in the active site are evident in the series as the enzyme moves through its catalytic cycle, namely nitrite reduction, which is a vital step in the global denitrification process. It is proposed that such a serial crystallography approach is widely applicable for studying any redox or electron-driven enzyme reactions from a single protein crystal. It can provide a `catalytic reaction movie' highlighting the structural changes that occur during enzyme catalysis. The anticipated developments in the automation of data analysis and modelling are likely to allow seamless and near-real-time analysis of such data on-site at some of the powerful synchrotron crystallographic beamlines.},

abstract = {Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is an increasingly popular technique that provides low-resolution structural information about biological macromolecules in solution. Many of the practical limitations of the technique, such as minimum required sample volume, and of experimental design, such as sample flow cells, are necessary because the biological samples are sensitive to damage from the X-rays. Radiation damage typically manifests as aggregation of the sample, which makes the collected data unreliable. However, there has been little systematic investigation of the most effective methods to reduce damage rates, and results from previous damage studies are not easily compared with results from other beamlines. Here a methodology is provided for quantifying radiation damage in SAXS to provide consistent results between different experiments, experimenters and beamlines. These methods are demonstrated on radiation damage data collected from lysozyme, glucose isomerase and xylanase, and it is found that no single metric is sufficient to describe radiation damage in SAXS for all samples. The radius of gyration, molecular weight and integrated SAXS profile intensity constitute a minimal set of parameters that capture all types of observed behavior. Radiation sensitivities derived from these parameters show a large protein dependence, varying by up to six orders of magnitude between the different proteins tested. This work should enable consistent reporting of radiation damage effects, allowing more systematic studies of the most effective minimization strategies.},

abstract = {The vast majority of biomolecular processes are controlled or facilitated by water interactions. In enzymes, regulatory proteins, membrane-bound receptors and ion-channels, water bound to functionally important residues creates hydrogen-bonding networks that underlie the mechanism of action of the macromolecule. High-resolution X-ray structures are often difficult to obtain with many of these classes of proteins because sample conditions, such as the necessity of detergents, often impede crystallization. Other biophysical techniques such as neutron scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are useful for studying internal water, though each has its own advantages and drawbacks, and often a hybrid approach is required to address important biological problems associated with protein–water interactions. One major area requiring more investigation is the study of bound water molecules which reside in cavities and channels and which are often involved in both the structural and functional aspects of receptor, transporter and ion channel proteins. In recent years, significant progress has been made in synchrotron-based radiolytic labeling and mass spectroscopy techniques for both the identification of bound waters and for characterizing the role of water in protein conformational changes at a high degree of spatial and temporal resolution. Here the latest developments and future capabilities of this method for investigating water–protein interactions and its synergy with other synchrotron-based methods are discussed.},

abstract = {Merging of data from multiple crystals has proven to be useful for determination of the anomalously scattering atomic substructure for crystals with weak anomalous scatterers ( e.g. S and P) and/or poor diffraction. Strategies for merging data from many samples, which require assessment of sample isomorphism, rely on metrics of variability in unit-cell parameters, anomalous signal correlation and overall data similarity. Local scaling, anomalous signal optimization and data-set weighting, implemented in phenix.scale_and_merge , provide an efficient protocol for merging data from many samples. The protein NS1 was used in a series of trials with data collected from 28 samples for phasing by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction of the native S atoms. The local-scaling, anomalous-optimization protocol produced merged data sets with higher anomalous signal quality indicators than did standard global-scaling protocols. The local-scaled data were also more successful in substructure determination. Merged data quality was assessed for data sets where the multiplicity was reduced in either of two ways: by excluding data from individual crystals (to reduce errors owing to non-isomorphism) or by excluding the last-recorded segments of data from each crystal (to minimize the effects of radiation damage). The anomalous signal was equivalent at equivalent multiplicity for the two procedures, and structure-determination success correlated with anomalous signal metrics. The quality of the anomalous signal was strongly correlated with data multiplicity over a range of 12-fold to 150-fold multiplicity. For the NS1 data, the local-scaling and anomalous-optimization protocol handled sample non-isomorphism and radiation-induced decay equally well.},

While its utility has been instrumental in progressing our knowledge of structures of molecules, it suffers from limitations such as the need for large, well-diffracting crystals, and radiation damage that can hamper native structural determination. The recent advent of X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) and their implementation in the emerging field of serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) has given rise to a remarkable expansion upon existing crystallographic constraints, allowing structural biologists access to previously restricted scientific territory. SFX relies on exceptionally brilliant, micro-focused X-ray pulses, which are femtoseconds in duration, to probe nano/micrometer sized crystals in a serial fashion. This results in data sets comprised of individual snapshots, each capturing Bragg diffraction of single crystals in random orientations prior to their subsequent destruction. Thus structural elucidation while avoiding radiation damage, even at room temperature, can now be achieved. This emerging field has cultivated new methods for nanocrystallogenesis, sample delivery, and data processing. Opportunities and challenges within SFX are reviewed herein.},

abstract = {Crystallization is a key step in macromolecular structure determination by crystallography. While a robust theoretical treatment of the process is available, due to the complexity of the system, the experimental process is still largely one of trial and error. In this article, efforts in the field are discussed together with a theoretical underpinning using a solubility phase diagram. Prior knowledge has been used to develop tools that computationally predict the crystallization outcome and define mutational approaches that enhance the likelihood of crystallization. For the most part these tools are based on binary outcomes (crystal or no crystal), and the full information contained in an assembly of crystallization screening experiments is lost. The potential of this additional information is illustrated by examples where new biological knowledge can be obtained and where a target can be sub-categorized to predict which class of reagents provides the crystallization driving force. Computational analysis of crystallization requires complete and correctly formatted data. While massive crystallization screening efforts are under way, the data available from many of these studies are sparse. The potential for this data and the steps needed to realize this potential are discussed.},

abstract = {Protein crystallization and subsequent X-ray diffraction analysis of the three-dimensional structure are necessary for elucidation of the biological functions of proteins and effective rational drug design. Therefore, controlling protein crystallization is important to obtain high resolution X-ray diffraction data. Here, a simple microfluidic method using chips with 10 and 50 $\mu$m high crystallization chambers to selectively form suitable single protein crystals for X-ray analysis is demonstrated. As proof of concept, three different types of proteins: lysozyme, glucokinase from Pseudoalteromonas sp. AS-131 (PsGK), and NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase-heme oxygenase complex were crystallized. We demonstrate that the crystal growth orientation depends on the height of the crystallization chamber regardless of the protein type. Our results suggest that the confined micro space induces the protein molecules to adhere to a specific crystal face and affects the growth kinetics of each crystal face. The present microfluidic-based protein crystallization method can reform a suitable single protein crystal for X-ray analysis from aggregates of needle-shaped protein crystals.},

However, experimental evidence is presented here that SFX data sets obtained by techniques that expose different parts of the same specimen to single pulses of radiation do not have this property, even if the specimen in question is frozen. The diffraction image of each such crystal obtained with the first pulse of radiation is certain to represent the structure of a protein that has not been modified chemically, but all of the images obtained subsequently from the same crystal will represent structures that have been modified to a lesser or greater extent by oxygen additions because of the rapid diffusion of oxygenic free radicals through the specimen. The higher the level of oxygen additions a crystal suffers during data collection, the poorer the statistical quality of data set obtained from it will, and the higher the free R-factors of the resulting structural model.},

New fluorescent-protein genes have now been found in the phylum Chordata, coding for particularly bright oligomeric fluorescent proteins such as the tetrameric yellow fluorescent protein lan YFP from Branchiostoma lanceolatum . A successful monomerization attempt led to the development of the bright yellow-green fluorescent protein mNeonGreen. The structures of lan YFP and mNeonGreen have been determined and compared in order to rationalize the directed evolution process leading from a bright, tetrameric to a still bright, monomeric fluorescent protein. An unusual discolouration of crystals of mNeonGreen was observed after X-ray data collection, which was investigated using a combination of X-ray crystallography and UV–visible absorption and Raman spectroscopies, revealing the effects of specific radiation damage in the chromophore cavity. It is shown that X-rays rapidly lead to the protonation of the phenolate O atom of the chromophore and to the loss of its planarity at the methylene bridge.},

abstract = {Macromolecular crystallography (MX) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies on proteins at synchrotron light sources are commonly limited by the structural damage produced by the intense X-ray beam. Several effects, such as aggregation in protein solutions and global and site-specific damage in crystals, reduce the data quality or even introduce artefacts that can result in a biologically misguiding structure. One strategy to reduce these negative effects is the inclusion of an additive in the buffer solution to act as a free radical scavenger. Here the properties of uridine as a scavenger for both SAXS and MX experiments on lysozyme at room temperature are examined. In MX experiments, upon addition of uridine at 1 M , the critical dose D 1/2 is increased by a factor of ∼1.7, a value similar to that obtained in the presence of the most commonly used scavengers such as ascorbate and sodium nitrate. Other figures of merit to assess radiation damage show a similar trend. In SAXS experiments, the scavenging effect of 40 m M uridine is similar to that of 5% v/v glycerol, and greater than 2 m M DTT and 1 m M ascorbic acid. In all cases, the protective effect of uridine is proportional to its concentration.},

abstract = {Biological small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is an increasingly popular technique used to obtain nanoscale structural information on macromolecules in solution. However, radiation damage to the samples limits the amount of useful data that can be collected from a single sample. In contrast to the extensive analytical resources available for macromolecular crystallography (MX), there are relatively few tools to quantitate radiation damage for SAXS, some of which require a significant level of manual characterization, with the potential of leading to conflicting results from different studies. Here, computational tools have been developed to automate and standardize radiation damage analysis for SAXS data. RADDOSE-3D , a dose calculation software utility originally written for MX experiments, has been extended to account for the cylindrical geometry of the capillary tube, the liquid composition of the sample and the attenuation of the beam by the capillary material to allow doses to be calculated for many SAXS experiments. Furthermore, a library has been written to visualize and explore the pairwise similarity of frames. The calculated dose for the frame at which three subsequent frames are determined to be dissimilar is defined as the radiation damage onset threshold (RDOT). Analysis of RDOTs has been used to compare the efficacy of radioprotectant compounds to extend the useful lifetime of SAXS samples. Comparison of the RDOTs shows that, for radioprotectant compounds at 5 and 10 m M concentration, glycerol is the most effective compound. However, at 1 and 2 m M concentrations, dithiothreitol (DTT) appears to be most effective. Our newly developed visualization library contains methods that highlight the unusual radiation damage results given by SAXS data collected using higher concentrations of DTT: these observations should pave the way to the development of more sophisticated frame merging strategies.},

abstract = {Serial crystallography, in which single-shot diffraction images are collected, has great potential for protein microcrystallography. Although serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) has been successfully demonstrated, limited beam time prevents its routine use. Inspired by SFX, serial synchrotron crystallography (SSX) has been investigated at synchrotron macromolecular crystallography beamlines. Unlike SFX, the longer exposure time of milliseconds to seconds commonly used in SSX causes radiation damage. However, in SSX, crystals can be rotated during the exposure, which can achieve efficient coverage of the reciprocal space. In this study, mercury single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (Hg-SAD) phasing of the luciferin regenerating enzyme (LRE) was performed using serial synchrotron rotation crystallography. The advantages of rotation and influence of dose on the data collected were evaluated. The results showed that sample rotation was effective for accurate data collection, and the optimum helical rotation step depended on multiple factors such as multiplicity and partiality of reflections, exposure time per rotation angle and the contribution from background scattering. For the LRE microcrystals, 0.25° was the best rotation step for the achievable resolution limit, whereas a rotation step larger than or equal to 1° was favorable for Hg-SAD phasing. Although an accumulated dose beyond 1.1 MGy caused specific damage at the Hg site, increases in resolution and anomalous signal were observed up to 3.4 MGy because of a higher signal-to-noise ratio.},

abstract = {During macromolecular X-ray crystallography experiments, protein crystals held at 100 K have been widely reported to exhibit reproducible bond scission events at doses on the order of several MGy. With the objective to mitigate the impact of radiation damage events on valid structure determination, it is essential to correctly understand the radiation chemistry mechanisms at play. OH-cleavage from tyrosine residues is regularly cited as amongst the most available damage pathways in protein crystals at 100 K, despite a lack of widespread reports of this phenomenon in protein crystal radiation damage studies. Furthermore, no clear mechanism for phenolic C—O bond cleavage in tyrosine has been reported, with the tyrosyl radical known to be relatively robust and long-lived in both aqueous solutions and the solid state. Here, the initial findings of Tyr –OH group damage in a myrosinase protein crystal have been reviewed. Consistent with that study, at increasing doses, clear electron density loss was detectable local to Tyr –OH groups. A systematic investigation performed on a range of protein crystal damage series deposited in the Protein Data Bank has established that Tyr –OH electron density loss is not generally a dominant damage pathway in protein crystals at 100 K. Full Tyr aromatic ring displacement is here proposed to account for instances of observable Tyr –OH electron density loss, with the original myrosinase data shown to be consistent with such a damage model. Systematic analysis of the effects of other environmental factors, including solvent accessibility and proximity to disulfide bonds or hydrogen bond interactions, is also presented. Residues in known active sites showed enhanced sensitivity to radiation-induced disordering, as has previously been reported.},

The knowledge of these biomolecular structures has significantly advanced our understanding of biological phenomena at the molecular level and has facilitated pharmaceutical development. Despite the considerable success of X-ray crystallography in determining the structures of biomolecules, this method still has fundamental limitations. Large amounts of high purity proteins are required for crystallization and procuring adequate well-organized crystal, which is sufficient to determine the atomic structure, is sometimes very difficult. Therefore, many of macromolecular complex (>100 kDa), polymerizing proteins, integral membrane proteins, and proteins with multiple conformations or with flexible domain have been awaiting the birth of new technology, high-resolution CryoEM, for their structure analysis. The invention of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) by Ernst Ruska in the 1930s was immediately welcomed by physicists and materials scientists owing to its wide range of applications. However, this was not the case for biologists mainly because of the intrinsic problems associated with biomolecules. In particular, biomolecules are sensitive to radiation damage, can be easily dehydrated under the high vacuum conditions required for TEM, and have poor electron scattering capability due to their low weight elemental composition. To overcome these issues, negative staining, which involves embedding a biomolecule in a layer of dried heavy metal solution, such as uranyl formate or uranyl acetate, was first employed in the 1940s and was further refined during the next 20 years (Brenner & Horne, 1959; Hall et al., 1945; Huxley & Zubay, 1961). This specimen preparation for TEM is quick and easy, and allows the collection of detailed information about the morphology of bacteria, viruses, organelles, and protein complexes.

abstract = {X-ray radiation in macromolecular crystallography can chemically alter the biological material and deteriorate the integrity of the crystal lattice with concomitant loss of resolution. Typical alterations include decarboxylation of glutamic and aspartic residues, breaking of disulfide bonds and the reduction of metal centres. Helical scans add a small translation to the crystal in the rotation method, so that for every image the crystal is shifted to expose a fresh part. On beamline PROXIMA 2A at Synchrotron SOLEIL, this procedure has been tested with various parameters in an attempt to understand how to mitigate the effects of radiation damage. Here, the strategies used and the crystallographic metrics for various scenarios are reported. Among these, the loss of bromine from bromophenyl moieties appears to be a useful monitor of radiation damage as the carbon-bromine bond is very sensitive to X-ray irradiation. Two cases are focused on where helical scans are shown to be superior in obtaining meaningful data compared with conventional methods. In one case the initial resolution of the crystal is extended over time, and in the second case the anomalous signal is preserved to provide greater effective multiplicity and easier phasing.},

abstract = {Recombinant protein expression is one of the key issues in protein engineering and biotechnology. Among the different models for assessing protein production and structure-function studies, green fluorescent protein (GFP) is one of the preferred models because of its importance as a reporter in cellular and molecular studies. In this research we analyze the effect of codon deletions near the amino terminus of different GFP proteins on fluorescence. Our study includes Gly4 deletions in the enhanced GFP (EGFP), the red-shifted GFP and the red-shifted EGFP. The Gly4 deletion mutants and their corresponding wild-type counterparts were transcribed under the control of the T7 or Trc promoters and their expression patterns were analyzed. Different fluorescent outcomes were observed depending on the type of fluorescent gene versions. In silico analysis of the RNA secondary structures near the ribosome binding site revealed a direct relationship between their minimum free energy and GFP production. Integrative analysis of these results, including SDS-PAGE analysis, led us to conclude that the fluorescence improvement of cells expressing different versions of GFPs with Gly4 deleted is due to an enhancement of the accessibility of the ribosome binding site by reducing the stability of the RNA secondary structures at their mRNA leader regions.},

abstract = {The progress in X-ray microbeam applications using synchrotron radiation is beneficial to structure determination from macromolecular microcrystals such as small in meso crystals. However, the high intensity of microbeams causes severe radiation damage, which worsens both the statistical quality of diffraction data and their resolution, and in the worst cases results in the failure of structure determination. Even in the event of successful structure determination, site-specific damage can lead to the misinterpretation of structural features. In order to overcome this issue, technological developments in sample handling and delivery, data-collection strategy and data processing have been made. For a few crystals with dimensions of the order of 10 µm, an elegant two-step scanning strategy works well. For smaller samples, the development of a novel method to analyze multiple isomorphous microcrystals was motivated by the success of serial femtosecond crystallography with X-ray free-electron lasers. This method overcame the radiation-dose limit in diffraction data collection by using a sufficient number of crystals. Here, important technologies and the future prospects for microcrystallography are discussed.},

abstract = {Protein crystallization remains difficult to rationalize and screening for optimal crystallization conditions is a tedious and time consuming procedure. Here, we report a hetero-micro-seeding strategy for producing high resolution crystals of closely related protein variants, where micro crystals from a readily crystallized variant are used as seeds to develop crystals of other variants less amenable to crystallization. We applied this strategy to Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI) variants, which would not crystallize using standard crystallization practice. Out of six variants in our analysis, only one called BPTI-[5,55]A14G formed well behaving crystals; and the remaining five (A14GA38G, A14GA38V, A14GA38L, A14GA38I, and A14GA38K) could be crystallized only using micro-seeds from the BPTI-[5,55]A14G crystal. All hetero-seeded crystals diffracted at high resolution with minimum mosaicity, retaining the same space group and cell dimension. Moreover, hetero-micro-seeding did not introduce any biases into the mutant's structure toward the seed structure, as demonstrated by A14GA38I structures solved using micro-seeds from A14GA38G, A14GA38L and A14GA38I. Though hetero-micro-seeding is a simple and almost na{\"{i}}ve strategy, this is the first direct demonstration of its workability. We believe that hetero-micro-seeding, which is contrasting with the popular idea that crystallization requires highly purified proteins, could contribute a new tool for rapidly solving protein structures in mutational analysis studies.},

abstract = {Background: Large number of features are extracted from protein crystallization trial images to improve the accuracy of classifiers for predicting the presence of crystals or phases of the crystallization process. The excessive number of features and computationally intensive image processing methods to extract these features make utilization of automated classification tools on stand-alone computing systems inconvenient due to the required time to complete the classification tasks. Combinations of image feature sets, feature reduction and classification techniques for crystallization images benefiting from trace fluorescence labeling are investigated. Results: Features are categorized into intensity, graph, histogram, texture, shape adaptive, and region features (using binarized images generated by Otsu's, green percentile, and morphological thresholding). The effects of normalization, feature reduction with principle components analysis (PCA), and feature selection using random forest classifier are also analyzed. The time required to extract feature categories is computed and an estimated time of extraction is provided for feature category combinations. We have conducted around 8624 experiments (different combinations of feature categories, binarization methods, feature reduction/selection, normalization, and crystal categories). The best experimental results are obtained using combinations of intensity features, region features using Otsu's thresholding, region features using green percentile G 90 thresholding, region features using green percentile G 99 thresholding, graph features, and histogram features. Using this feature set combination, 96% accuracy (without misclassifying crystals as non-crystals) was achieved for the first level of classification to determine presence of crystals. Since missing a crystal is not desired, our algorithm is adjusted to achieve a high sensitivity rate. In the second level classification, 74.2% accuracy for (5-class) crystal sub-category classification. Best classification rates were achieved using random forest classifier. Contributions: The feature extraction and classification could be completed in about 2 s per image on a stand-alone computing system, which is suitable for real time analysis. These results enable research groups to select features according to their hardware setups for real-time analysis.},

This approach offers several advantages over flow cell studies. It provides (i) room temperature structures at near atomic resolution, (ii) time resolution ranging from microseconds to seconds, and (iii) convenient reaction initiation. It outruns radiation damage by using femtosecond X-ray pulses allowing damage and chemistry to be separated. Here, we demonstrate that MISC is feasible at an X-ray free electron laser by studying the reaction of M. tuberculosis {\ss}-lactamase microcrystals with ceftriaxone antibiotic solution. Electron density maps of the apo-{\ss}-lactamase and of the ceftriaxone bound form were obtained at 2.8 {\AA} and 2.4 {\AA} resolution, respectively. These results pave the way to study cyclic and non-cyclic reactions and represent a new field of time-resolved structural dynamics for numerous substrate-triggered biological reactions.},

abstract = {Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions are pervasively used to study structures and processes. Specific GFP-binders are thus of great utility for detection, immobilization or manipulation of GFP-fused molecules. We determined structures of two designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins), complexed with GFP, which revealed different but overlapping epitopes. Here we show a structure-guided design strategy that, by truncation and computational reengineering, led to a stable construct where both can bind simultaneously: by linkage of the two binders, fusion constructs were obtained that "wrap around" GFP, have very high affinities of about 10-30 pM, and extremely slow off-rates. They can be natively produced in E. coli in very large amounts, and show excellent biophysical properties. Their very high stability and affinity, facile site-directed functionalization at introduced unique lysines or cysteines facilitate many applications. As examples, we present them as tight yet reversible immobilization reagents for surface plasmon resonance, as fluorescently labelled monomeric detection reagents in flow cytometry, as pull-down ligands to selectively enrich GFP fusion proteins from cell extracts, and as affinity column ligands for inexpensive large-scale protein purification. We have thus described a general design strategy to create a "clamp" from two different high-affinity repeat proteins, even if their epitopes overlap.},

abstract = {X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) have the potential to revolutionize macromolecular structural biology due to the unique combination of spatial coherence, extreme peak brilliance, and short duration of X-ray pulses. A recently emerged serial femtosecond (fs) crystallography (SFX) approach using XFEL radiation overcomes some of the biggest hurdles of traditional crystallography related to radiation damage through the diffraction-before-destruction principle. Intense fs XFEL pulses enable high-resolution room-temperature structure determination of difficult-to-crystallize biological macromolecules, while simultaneously opening a new era of time-resolved structural studies. Here, we review the latest developments in instrumentation, sample delivery, data analysis, crystallization methods, and applications of SFX to important biological questions, and conclude with brief insights into the bright future of structural biology using XFELs. XFELs allow radiation damage to be overcome, enabling the determination of high-resolution room-temperature structures of difficult-to-crystallize proteins, for which only small crystals are available, and of extremely radiation-sensitive macromolecules, such as metalloenzymes. De novo phasing at XFELs has been established on several different targets and by different methods, thereby enabling the determination of the structure of novel macromolecules of biological interest. The extremely short fs duration of XFEL pulses provides access to dynamic information about unstable intermediate states and irreversible reactions. The development of new injectors, crystal delivery media, and fixed target devices has dramatically reduced the amount of required crystallized protein. Mixing injectors provide an important avenue to study biological interactions in 4D space. Developments in data-processing software have reduced the required amount of data and improved data quality.},

However, de novo structure determination, i.e., without prior structural knowledge, is complicated by the inherent inaccuracy of serial femtosecond crystallography data. By its very nature, serial femtosecond crystallography data collection entails shot-to-shot fluctuations in X-ray wavelength and intensity as well as variations in crystal size and quality that must be averaged out. Hence, to obtain accurate diffraction intensities for de novo phasing, large numbers of diffraction patterns are required, and, concomitantly large volumes of sample and long X-ray free-electron laser beamtimes. Here we show that serial femtosecond crystallography data collected using simultaneous two-colour X-ray free-electron laser pulses can be used for multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing. The phase angle determination is significantly more accurate than for single-colour phasing. We anticipate that two-colour multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing will enhance structure determination of difficult-to-phase proteins at X-ray free-electron lasers.},

abstract = {The intensities of far-field diffraction patterns of orientationally aligned molecules obey Wilson statistics, whether those molecules are in isolation (giving rise to a continuous diffraction pattern) or arranged in a crystal (giving rise to Bragg peaks). Ensembles of molecules in several orientations, but uncorrelated in position, give rise to the incoherent sum of the diffraction from those objects, modifying the statistics in a similar way as crystal twinning modifies the distribution of Bragg intensities. This situation arises in the continuous diffraction of laser-aligned molecules or translationally disordered molecular crystals. This paper develops the analysis of the intensity statistics of such continuous diffraction to obtain parameters such as scaling, beam coherence and the number of contributing independent object orientations. When measured, continuous molecular diffraction is generally weak and accompanied by a background that far exceeds the strength of the signal. Instead of just relying upon the smallest measured intensities or their mean value to guide the subtraction of the background, it is shown how all measured values can be utilized to estimate the background, noise and signal, by employing a modified 'noisy Wilson' distribution that explicitly includes the background. Parameters relating to the background and signal quantities can be estimated from the moments of the measured intensities. The analysis method is demonstrated on previously published continuous diffraction data measured from crystals of photosystem II [Ayyer et al. (2016), Nature, 530, 202-206].},

abstract = {The proliferation of extremely intense synchrotron sources has enabled ever higher-resolution structures to be obtained using data collected from smaller and often more imperfect biological crystals (Helliwell, 1984). Synchrotron beamlines now exist that are capable of measuring data from single crystals that are just a few micrometres in size. This provides renewed motivation to study and understand the radiation damage behaviour of small protein crystals. Reciprocal-space mapping and Bragg coherent diffractive imaging experiments have been performed on cryo-cooled microcrystals of hen egg-white lysozyme as they undergo radiation damage. Several well established metrics, such as intensity-loss and lattice expansion, are applied to the diffraction data and the results are compared with several new metrics that can be extracted from the coherent imaging experiments. Individually some of these metrics are inconclusive. However, combining metrics, the results suggest that radiation damage behaviour in protein micro-crystals differs from that of larger protein crystals and may allow them to continue to diffract for longer. A possible mechanism to account for these observations is proposed.},

abstract = {Serial synchrotron-based crystallography using intense microfocused X-ray beams, fast-framing detectors and protein microcrystals held at 300 K promises to expand the range of accessible structural targets and to increase overall structure-pipeline throughputs. To explore the nature and consequences of X-ray radiation damage under microbeam illumination, the time-, dose- and temperature-dependent evolution of crystal diffraction have been measured with maximum dose rates of 50 MGy s −1 . At all temperatures and dose rates, the integrated diffraction intensity for a fixed crystal orientation shows non-exponential decays with dose. Non-exponential decays are a consequence of non-uniform illumination and the resulting spatial evolution of diffracted intensity within the illuminated crystal volume. To quantify radiation-damage lifetimes and the damage state of diffracting crystal regions, a revised diffraction-weighted dose (DWD) is defined and it is shown that for Gaussian beams the DWD becomes nearly independent of actual dose at large doses. An apparent delayed onset of radiation damage seen in some intensity–dose curves is in fact a consequence of damage. Intensity fluctuations at high dose rates may arise from the impulsive release of gaseous damage products. Accounting for these effects, data collection at the highest dose rates increases crystal radiation lifetimes near 300 K (but not at 100 K) by a factor of ∼1.5–2 compared with those observed at conventional dose rates. Improved quantification and modeling of the complex spatio-temporal evolution of protein microcrystal diffraction in intense microbeams will enable more efficient data collection, and will be essential in improving the accuracy of structure factors and structural models.},

abstract = {Protein crystallography data collection at synchrotrons is routinely carried out at cryogenic temperatures to mitigate radiation damage. Although damage still takes place at 100 K and below, the immobilization of free radicals increases the lifetime of the crystals by approximately 100-fold. Recent studies have shown that flash-cooling decreases the heterogeneity of the conformational ensemble and can hide important functional mechanisms from observation. These discoveries have motivated increasing numbers of experiments to be carried out at room temperature. However, the trade-offs between increased risk of radiation damage and increased observation of alternative conformations at room temperature relative to cryogenic temperature have not been examined. A considerable amount of effort has previously been spent studying radiation damage at cryo-temperatures, but the relevance of these studies to room temperature diffraction is not well understood. Here, the effects of radiation damage on the conformational landscapes of three different proteins ( T. danielli thaumatin, hen egg-white lysozyme and human cyclophilin A) at room (278 K) and cryogenic (100 K) temperatures are investigated. Increasingly damaged datasets were collected at each temperature, up to a maximum dose of the order of 10 7 Gy at 100 K and 10 5 Gy at 278 K. Although it was not possible to discern a clear trend between damage and multiple conformations at either temperature, it was observed that disorder, monitored by B -factor-dependent crystallographic order parameters, increased with higher absorbed dose for the three proteins at 100 K. At 278 K, however, the total increase in this disorder was only statistically significant for thaumatin. A correlation between specific radiation damage affecting side chains and the amount of disorder was not observed. This analysis suggests that elevated conformational heterogeneity in crystal structures at room temperature is observed despite radiation damage, and not as a result thereof.},

abstract = {Background: Protein crystal structures are potentially over-interpreted since they are routinely refined without any restraint on the upper limit of atomic B-factors. Consequently, some of their atoms, undetected in the electron density maps, are allowed to reach extremely large B-factors, even above 100 square Angstroms, and their final positions are purely speculative and not based on any experimental evidence. Results: A strategy to define B-factors upper limits is described here, based on the analysis of protein crystal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank prior 2008, when the tendency to allow B-factor to arbitrary inflate was limited. This B-factor upper limit (B_max) is determined by extrapolating the relationship between crystal structure average B-factor and percentage of crystal volume occupied by solvent (pcVol) to pcVol =100%, when, ab absurdo, the crystal contains only liquid solvent, the structure of which is, by definition, undetectable in electron density maps. Conclusions: It is thus possible to highlight structures with average B-factors larger than B_max, which should be considered with caution by the users of the information deposited in the Protein Data Bank, in order to avoid scientifically deleterious over-interpretations.},

@article{Marman2018,
abstract = {Radiation damage represents a fundamental limit in the determination of protein structures via macromolecular crystallography (MX) at third-generation synchrotron sources. Over the past decade, improvements in both source and detector technology have led to MX experiments being performed with smaller and smaller crystals (on the order of a few microns), often using microfocus beams. Under these conditions, photoelectrons (PEs), the primary agents of radiation-damage in MX, may escape the diffraction volume prior to depositing all of their energy. The impact of PE escape is more significant at higher beam energies (>20 keV) as the electron inelastic mean free path (IMFP) is longer, allowing the electrons to deposit their energy over a larger area, extending further from their point of origin. Software such as RADDOSE-3D has been used extensively to predict the dose (energy absorbed per unit mass) that a crystal will absorb under a given set of experimental parameters and is an important component in planning a successful MX experiment. At the time this study was undertaken, dose predictions made using RADDOSE-3D were spatially-resolved, but did not yet account for the propagation of PEs through the diffraction volume. Hence, in the case of microfocus crystallography, it is anticipated that deviations may occur between the predicted and actual dose absorbed due to the influence of PEs. To explore this effect, we conducted a series of simulations of the dose absorbed by micron-sized crystals during microfocus MX experiments. Our simulations spanned beam and crystal sizes ranging from 1$\mu$m to 5$\mu$m for beam energies between 9 keV and 30 keV. Our simulations were spatially and temporarily resolved and accounted for the escape of PEs from the diffraction volume. The spatially-resolved dose maps produced by these simulations were used to predict the rate of intensity loss in a Bragg spot, a key metric for tracking global radiation damage. Our results were compared to predictions obtained using a recent version of RADDOSE-3D that did not account for PE escape; the predicted crystal lifetimes are shown to differ significantly for the smallest crystals and for high-energy beams, when PE escape is included in the simulations.},

In this study, the ATPSs comprising N,N-dimethylammonium N',N'-dimethylcarbamate (DIMCARB) and thermo-responsive poly(propylene) glycol (PPG) were applied for the recovery of recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP) derived from Escherichia coli. The partition behavior of GFP in the PPG + DIMCARB + water system was investigated systematically by varying the molecular weight of PPG and the total composition of ATPS. Overall, GFP was found to be preferentially partitioned to the hydrophilic DIMCARB-rich phase. An ATPS composed of 42% (w/w) PPG 1000 and 4.4% (w/w) DIMCARB gave the optimum performance in terms of GFP selectivity (1,237) and yield (98.8%). The optimal system was also successfully scaled up by 50 times without compromising the purification performance. The bottom phase containing GFP was subjected to rotary evaporation of DIMCARB. The stability of GFP was not affected by the distillation of DIMCARB, and the DIMCARB was successfully recycled in three successive rounds of GFP purification. The potential of PPG + DIMCARB + water system as a sustainable protein purification tool is promising.},

abstract = {A method of analysis is presented that allows for the separation of specific radiation-induced changes into distinct components in real space. The method relies on independent component analysis (ICA) and can be effectively applied to electron density maps and other types of maps, provided that they can be represented as sets of numbers on a grid. Here, for glucose isomerase crystals, ICA was used in a proof-of-concept analysis to separate temperature-dependent and temperature-independent components of specific radiation-induced changes for data sets acquired from multiple crystals across multiple temperatures. ICA identified two components, with the temperature-independent component being responsible for the majority of specific radiation-induced changes at temperatures below 130 K. The patterns of specific temperature-independent radiation-induced changes suggest a contribution from the tunnelling of electron holes as a possible explanation. In the second case, where a group of 22 data sets was collected on a single thaumatin crystal, ICA was used in another type of analysis to separate specific radiation-induced effects happening on different exposure-level scales. Here, ICA identified two components of specific radiation-induced changes that likely result from radiation-induced chemical reactions progressing with different rates at different locations in the structure. In addition, ICA unexpectedly identified the radiation-damage state corresponding to reduced disulfide bridges rather than the zero-dose extrapolated state as the highest contrast structure. The application of ICA to the analysis of specific radiation-induced changes in real space and the data pre-processing for ICA that relies on singular value decomposition, which was used previously in data space to validate a two-component physical model of X-ray radiation-induced changes, are discussed in detail. This work lays a foundation for a better understanding of protein-specific radiation chemistries and provides a framework for analysing effects of specific radiation damage in crystallographic and cryo-EM experiments.},

abstract = {Circularly permuted proteins (cpPs) represent a novel type of mutant proteins with original termini that are covalently linked through a peptide connector and opened at any other place of the polypeptide backbone to create new ends. cpPs are finding wide applications in biotechnology because their properties may be quite different from those of the parental protein. However, the actual challenge for the creation of successful cpPs is to identify those peptide bonds that can be broken to create new termini and ensure functional and well-folded cpPs. Herein, we describe CiPerGenesis, a combinatorial mutagenesis approach that uses two oligonucleotide libraries to amplify a circularized gene by PCR, starting and ending from a focused target region. This approach creates small libraries of circularly permuted genes that are easily cloned in the correct direction and frame using two different restriction sites encoded in the oligonucleotides. Once expressed, the protein libraries exhibit a unique sequence diversity, comprising cpPs that exhibit ordinary breakpoints between adjacent amino acids localized at the target region as well as cpPs with new termini containing user-defined truncations and repeats of some amino acids. CiPerGenesis was tested at the lid region G134-H148 of green fluorescent protein (GFP), revealing that the most fluorescent variants were those starting at Leu141 and ending at amino acids Tyr145, Tyr143, Glu142, Leu141, Lys140, and H139. Purification and biochemical characterization of some variants suggested a differential expression, solubility and maturation extent of the mutant proteins as the likely cause for the variability in fluorescence intensity observed in colonies.},

It has been used to solve structures of a diverse set of biomolecules and materials, in some cases to sub-atomic resolution. However, little is known about the damaging effects of the electron beam on samples during such measurements. We assess global and site-specific damage from electron radiation on nanocrystals of proteinase K and of a prion hepta-peptide and find that the dynamics of electron-induced damage follow well-established trends observed in X-ray crystallography. Metal ions are perturbed, disulfide bonds are broken, and acidic side chains are decarboxylated while the diffracted intensities decay exponentially with increasing exposure. A better understanding of radiation damage in MicroED improves our assessment and processing of all types of cryo-EM data. The scattered electrons in a cryo-EM measurement provide the information necessary to determine the atomic structure, but inevitably damage the sample. Radiation damage must be controlled to avoid compromising the result. Here, the relationship between exposure and damage is assessed in two different crystalline samples.},

abstract = {Recent advances in the field of electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) have resulted in a rapidly increasing number of atomic models of biomacromolecules that have been solved using this technique and deposited in the Protein Data Bank and the Electron Microscopy Data Bank. Similar to macromolecular crystallography, validation tools for these models and maps are required. While some of these validation tools may be borrowed from crystallography, new methods specifically designed for cryo-EM validation are required. Here, new computational methods and tools implemented in PHENIX are discussed, including d 99 to estimate resolution, phenix.auto_sharpen to improve maps and phenix.mtriage to analyze cryo-EM maps. It is suggested that cryo-EM half-maps and masks should be deposited to facilitate the evaluation and validation of cryo-EM-derived atomic models and maps. The application of these tools to deposited cryo-EM atomic models and maps is also presented.},

abstract = {MicroED is a method which combines cryo-EM sample preparation and instrumentation, with electron and X-ray crystallography data analysis, and it has been employed to solve many protein crystal structures at high resolution. Initially, the main doubts of this method for structure determination were the dynamic scattering of electrons, which would cause severe inaccuracies in the measured intensities. In this paper, we will review the evolution of MicroED data collection and processing, the major differences of multiple scattering effects in protein crystals and inorganic material, and the advantages of continuous rotation data collection. Additionally, because of the periodic nature of the crystalline sample, radiation doses can be kept significantly lower than those used in single particle data collection. We review the work where this was used to assess the radiation damage of a high-energy electron beam on the protein molecules at much lower dose ranges compared to imaging.},

abstract = {Electron diffraction is a relatively novel alternative to X-ray crystallography for the structure determination of macromolecules from three-dimensional nanometre-sized crystals. The continuous-rotation method of data collection has been adapted for the electron microscope. However, there are important differences in geometry that must be considered for successful data integration. The wavelength of electrons in a TEM is typically around 40 times shorter than that of X-rays, implying a nearly flat Ewald sphere, and consequently low diffraction angles and a high effective sample-to-detector distance. Nevertheless, the DIALS software package can, with specific adaptations, successfully process continuous-rotation electron diffraction data. Pathologies encountered specifically in electron diffraction make data integration more challenging. Errors can arise from instrumentation, such as beam drift or distorted diffraction patterns from lens imperfections. The diffraction geometry brings additional challenges such as strong correlation between lattice parameters and detector distance. These issues are compounded if calibration is incomplete, leading to uncertainty in experimental geometry, such as the effective detector distance and the rotation rate or direction. Dynamic scattering, absorption, radiation damage and incomplete wedges of data are additional factors that complicate data processing. Here, recent features of DIALS as adapted to electron diffraction processing are shown, including diagnostics for problematic diffraction geometry refinement, refinement of a smoothly varying beam model and corrections for distorted diffraction images. These novel features, combined with the existing tools in DIALS , make data integration and refinement feasible for electron crystallography, even in difficult cases.},

abstract = {The x-ray free electron lasers can enable diffractive structural determination of protein nanocrystals and single molecules that are too small and radiation-sensitive for conventional x-ray diffraction. However the electronic form factor may be modified during the ultrashort x-ray pulse due to photoionization and electron cascade caused by the intense x-ray pulse. For general x-ray imaging techniques, the minimization of the effects of radiation damage is of major concern to ensure reliable reconstruction of molecular structure. Here we show that radiation damage free diffraction can be achieved with atomic spatial resolution by using x-ray parametric down-conversion and ghost diffraction with entangled photons of x-ray and optical frequencies. We show that the formation of the diffraction patterns satisfies a condition analogous to the Bragg equation, with a resolution that can be as fine as the crystal lattice length scale of several ngstrom. Since the samples are illuminated by low energy optical photons, they can be free of radiation damage.},

abstract = {Fungal laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) are multi-copper oxidases that oxidize a wide variety of substrates. Despite extensive studies, the molecular basis for their diverse activity is unclear. Notably, there is no current way to rationally predict the activity of a laccase toward a given substrate. Such knowledge would greatly facilitate the rational design of new laccases for technological purposes. We report a study of three datasets of experimental Km values and activities for Trametes versicolor and Cerrena unicolor laccase, using a range of protein modeling techniques. We identify diverse binding modes of the various substrates and confirm an important role of Asp-206 and His-458 (T. versicolor laccase numbering) in guiding substrate recognition. Importantly, we demonstrate that experimental Km values correlate with binding affinities computed by MMGBSA. This confirms the common assumption that the protein-substrate affinity is a major contributor to observed Km. From quantitative structure-activity relations (QSAR) we identify physicochemical properties that correlate with observed Km and activities. In particular, the ionization potential, shape, and binding affinity of the substrate largely determine the enzyme's Km for the particular substrate. Our results suggest that Km is not just a binding constant but also contains features of the enzymatic activity. In addition, we identify QSAR models with only a few descriptors showing that phenolic substrates employ optimal hydrophobic packing to reach the T1 site, but then require additional electronic properties to engage in the subsequent electron transfer. Our results advance our ability to model laccase activity and lend promise to future rational optimization of laccases toward phenolic substrates.},

Over the last 30 years synchrotron radiation has nucleated a succession of advances, ranging from detectors to optics and automation. These advances, in turn, open up opportunities. For instance, a further order of magnitude could perhaps be gained in signal to noise for general synchrotron experiments. In addition, X-ray free-electron lasers offer to capture fragments of reciprocal space without radiation damage, and open up the subpicosecond regime of protein dynamics and activity. But electrons have recently stolen the limelight: so is X-ray crystallography in rude health, or will imaging methods, especially single-particle electron microscopy, render it obsolete for the most interesting biology, whilst electron diffraction enables structure determination from even the smallest crystals?

abstract = {The fluorescent protein (FP) color palette has greatly contributed to the visualization of molecular and cellular processes. However, most FPs lose fluorescence at a pH lower than their neutral pK a (∼6), and this has hampered their application in acidic organelles (pH ∼4.5–6.0). Currently, several cyan- and red-colored acid-tolerant FPs are available; however, there are few reports of acid-tolerant green FPs (GFPs) that are practically applicable to bioimaging. Here, we developed the acid-tolerant monomeric GFP “Gamillus” from the jellyfish Olindias formosa, with excellent brightness, maturation speed, and photostability. Results from X-ray crystallography and point mutagenesis suggest that across a broad pH range the acid tolerance is attributed to stabilization of deprotonation in the chromophore phenyl ring by forming a unique trans configuration. We demonstrate that Gamillus can serve as a molecular tag suitable for imaging in acidic organelles through autophagy-mediated molecular tracking to lysosomes. Shinoda et al. describe the cloning, engineering, and characterization of a monomeric GFP “Gamillus” from Olindias formosa. Gamillus has superior acid tolerance (pK a = 3.4) to reported other monomeric GFPs, and a unique trans chromophore configuration contributed to the acid tolerance. They demonstrate the usefulness for imaging in an acidic cellular environment, e.g., lysosomes.},

abstract = {Pharmaceutical grade trypsin is in ever-increasing demand for medical and industrial applications. Improving the efficiency of existing biotechnological manufacturing processes is therefore paramount. When produced biotechnologically, trypsinogen—the inactive precursor of trypsin—is advantageous, since active trypsin would impair cell viability. To study factors affecting cell physiology and the production of trypsinogen in fed-batch cultures, we built a fusion protein of porcine trypsinogen and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in Pichia pastoris. The experiments were performed with two different pH values (5.0 and 5.9) and two constant specific growth rates (0.02 and 0.04 1/h), maintained using exponential addition of methanol. All the productivity data presented rely on an active determination of trypsin obtained by proteolysis of the trypsinogen produced. The pH of the medium did not affect cell growth, but significantly influenced specific production of trypsinogen: A 1.7-fold higher concentration of trypsinogen was achieved at pH 5.9 (64 mg/L at 0.02 1/h) compared to pH 5.0. EGFP was primarily used to facilitate detection of intracellular protein over the biosynthetic time course. Using flow cytometry with fluorescence detection, cell disruption was avoided, and protein extraction and purification prior to analysis were unnecessary. However, Western blot and SDS-PAGE showed that cleavage of EGFP-trypsinogen fusion protein occurred, probably caused by Pichia-endogenous proteases. The fluorescence analysis did therefore not accurately represent the actual trypsinogen concentration. However, we gained new experimentally-relevant insights, which can be used to avoid misinterpretation of tracking and quantifying as well as online-monitoring of proteins with the frequently used fluorescent tags.},

abstract = {Radiation damage remains one of the major limitations to accurate structure determination in protein crystallography (PX). Despite the use of cryo-cooling techniques, it is highly probable that a number of the structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) have suffered substantial radiation damage as a result of the high flux densities of third generation synchrotron X-ray sources. Whereas the effects of global damage upon diffraction pattern reflection intensities are readily detectable, traditionally the (earlier onset) site-specific structural changes induced by radiation damage have proven difficult to identify within individual PX structures. More recently, however, development of the B Damage metric has helped to address this problem. B Damage is a quantitative, per-atom metric identifies potential sites of specific damage by comparing the atomic B -factor values of atoms that occupy a similar local packing density environment in the structure. Building upon this past work, this article presents a program, RABDAM , to calculate the B Damage metric for all selected atoms within any standard-format PDB or mmCIF file. RABDAM provides several useful outputs to assess the extent of damage suffered by an input PX structure. This free and open-source software will allow assessment and improvement of the quality of PX structures both previously and newly deposited in the PDB.},

Here, we report on neutron structures of trypsin determined at very high resolutions ≤1.5 {\AA} in uncomplexed and inhibited state complemented by X-ray and thermodynamic data and computer simulations. Our structures show the precise geometry of H-bonds between protein and the inhibitors N-amidinopiperidine and benzamidine along with the dynamics of the residual solvation pattern. Prior to binding, the ligand-free binding pocket is occupied by water molecules characterized by a paucity of H-bonds and high mobility resulting in an imperfect hydration of the critical residue Asp189. This phenomenon likely constitutes a key factor fueling ligand binding via water displacement and helps improving our current view on water influencing protein–ligand recognition.},

abstract = {The process of producing suitable crystals for X-ray diffraction analysis most often involves the setting up of hundreds (or thousands) of individual crystallization trials, each of which must be repeatedly examined for crystals or hints of crystallinity. Currently, the only real way to address this bottleneck is to use an automated imager to capture images of the trials. However, the images still need to be assessed for crystals or other outcomes. Ideally, there would exist some rapid and reliable machine-analysis tool to translate the images into a quantitative result. However, as yet no such tool exists in wide usage, despite this being a well recognized problem. One of the issues in creating robust automatic image-analysis software is the lack of reliable data for training machine-learning algorithms. Here, a mobile application, Cinder , has been developed which allows crystallization images to be scored quickly on a smartphone or tablet. The Cinder scores are inserted into the appropriate table in a crystallization database and are immediately available to the user through a more sophisticated web interface, allowing more detailed analyses. A sharp increase in the number of scored images was observed after Cinder was released, which in turn provides more data for training machine-learning tools.},

In this study, six peptides corresponding to the RCLs of the predominant Pin-II PIs were identified, synthesized and evaluated for in vitro and in vivo inhibitory activity against serine proteases of the polyphagous insect, Helicoverpa armigera. RCL peptides with sequences PRN, PRY and TRE were found to be potent inhibitors that adversely affected the growth and development of H. armigera. The binding mechanism and differential affinity of the RCL peptides with serine proteases was delineated by crystal structures of complexes of the RCL peptides with trypsin. Residues P1 and P2 of the inhibitors play a crucial role in the interaction and specificity of these inhibitors. Important features of RCL peptides like higher inhibition of insect proteases, enhanced efficacy at alkaline gut pH, longer retention and high stability in insect gut make them suitable molecules for the development of sustainable pest management strategies for crop protection.},

abstract = {Protein crystals are nanoporous materials. Despite this important characteristic, little is known about the conditions in the pores, also called channels. Here, we describe a method to study the calcium concentration and pH in the nanopores of thaumatin and lysozyme crystals. We load the crystal nanopores with fluorescent indicators and then perfuse the crystals with solutions of different calcium concentrations and pH while reading out the crystal's fluorescence intensity with confocal microscopy. By calibrating the fluorescence signal, we can determine the calcium concentration and pH in the nanopores. For the pH in thaumatin nanopores measured with the ratiometric pH sensor SNARF-1, we find a -0.7 pH shift compared to the bath pH corresponding to a fivefold higher proton concentration. This is similar to the -0.3 pH shift found in lysozyme nanopores. With single-wavelength probes, we find that the calcium concentration in thaumatin crystal nanopores is the same as in the bath, whereas it is 0.24 times lower in lysozyme nanopores. Summarizing, our experiments show that calcium concentration and pH in the nanopores of protein crystals can deviate significantly from that in the bath. In general, the described method can be applied for testing a wide range of ion or small-molecule concentrations in transparent nanoporous materials not only with ratiometric but also with single wavelength fluorescent indicators.},

abstract = {The development of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) has opened the possibility to investigate the ultrafast dynamics of biomacromolecules using X-ray diffraction. Whereas an increasing number of structures solved by means of serial femtosecond crystallography at XFELs is available, the effect of radiation damage on protein crystals during ultrafast exposures has remained an open question. We used a split-and-delay line based on diffractive X-ray optics at the Linac Coherent Light Source XFEL to investigate the time dependence of X-ray radiation damage to lysozyme crystals. For these tests, crystals were delivered to the X-ray beam using a fixed-target approach. The presented experiments provide probe signals at eight different delay times between 19 and 213 femtoseconds after a single pump event, thereby covering the time-scales relevant for femtosecond serial crystallography. Even though significant impact on the crystals was observed at long time scales after exposure with a single X-ray pulse, the collected diffraction data did not show significant signal reduction that could be assigned to beam damage on the crystals in the sampled time window and resolution range. This observation is in agreement with estimations of the applied radiation dose, which in our experiment was clearly below the values expected to cause damage on the femtosecond time scale. The experiments presented here demonstrate the feasibility of time-resolved pump-multiprobe X-ray diffraction experiments on protein crystals.},

abstract = {Cryocooling of macromolecular crystals is commonly employed to limit radiation damage during X-ray diffraction data collection. However, cooling itself affects macromolecular conformation and often damages crystals via poorly understood processes. Here, the effects of cryosolution thermal contraction on macromolecular conformation and crystal order in crystals ranging from 32 to 67% solvent content are systematically investigated. It is found that the solution thermal contraction affects macromolecule configurations and volumes, unit-cell volumes, crystal packing and crystal order. The effects occur through not only thermal contraction, but also pressure caused by the mismatched contraction of cryosolvent and pores. Higher solvent-content crystals are more affected. In some cases the solvent contraction can be adjusted to reduce mosaicity and increase the strength of diffraction. Ice formation in some crystals is found to cause damage via a reduction in unit-cell volume, which is interpreted through solvent transport out of unit cells during cooling. The results point to more deductive approaches to cryoprotection optimization by adjusting the cryosolution composition to reduce thermal contraction-induced stresses in the crystal with cooling.},

abstract = {Direct electron detectors (DEDs) have revolutionized cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) by facilitating the correction of beam-induced motion and radiation damage, and also by providing high-resolution image capture. A new-generation DED, the DE64, has been developed by Direct Electron that has good performance in both integrating and counting modes. The camera has been characterized in both modes in terms of image quality, throughput and resolution of cryo-EM reconstructions. The modulation transfer function, noise power spectrum and detective quantum efficiency (DQE) were determined for both modes, as well as the number of images per unit time. Although the DQE for counting mode was superior to that for integrating mode, the data-collection throughput for this mode was more than ten times slower. Since throughput and resolution are related in single-particle cryo-EM, data for apoferritin were collected and reconstructed using integrating mode, integrating mode in conjunction with a Volta phase plate (VPP) and counting mode. Only the counting-mode data resulted in a better than 3 {\AA} resolution reconstruction with similar numbers of particles, and this increased performance could not be compensated for by the increased throughput of integrating mode or by the increased low-frequency contrast of integrating mode with the VPP. These data show that the superior image quality provided by counting mode is more important for high-resolution cryo-EM reconstructions than the superior throughput of integrating mode.},

Data were collected at the Structural Biology I beamline (BL41XU) at SPring-8, using 30 keV X-rays and a highly sensitive pixel array detector equipped with a cadmium telluride sensor. The experimental setup of continuous sample translation using multiple crystals allowed the average diffraction weighted dose per data set to be reduced to 58 kGy, and the resulting data revealed a ligand structure featuring an identical bond length to that in the damage-free structure determined using an X-ray free-electron laser. However, precise analysis of the residual density around the ligand structure refined with the synchrotron data showed the possibility of a small level of specific damage, which might have resulted from the accumulated dose of 58 kGy per data set. Further investigation of the photon-energy dependence of specific damage, as assessed by variations in UV-vis absorption spectra, was conducted using an on-line spectrometer at various energies ranging from 10 to 30 keV. No evidence was found for specific radiation damage being energy dependent.},

Additionally, the structure of the complex with native BbKI was determined at 2.0 {\AA} resolution from P 6 4 crystals isomorphous to those of the mutant. Since BbKI has previously been found to be a potent inhibitor of the trypsin-like plasma kallikrein, it was also tested against several tissue kallikreins. It was found that BbKI is a potent inhibitor of human tissue kallikrein 4 (KLK4) and the chymotrypsin-like human tissue kallikrein 7 (KLK7). Structures of BbKI complexed with the catalytic domain of human plasma kallikrein were modeled, as well as those with KLK4 and KLK7, and the structures were analyzed in order to identify the interactions that are responsible for inhibitory potency.},

abstract = {Cysteine is a rare but functionally important amino acid that is often subject to covalent modification. Cysteine oxidation plays an important role in many human disease processes, and basal levels of cysteine oxidation are required for proper cellular function. Because reactive cysteine residues are typically ionized to the thiolate anion (Cys-S − ), their formation of a covalent bond alters the electrostatic and steric environment of the active site. X-ray-induced photo-oxidation to sulfenic acids (Cys-SOH) can recapitulate some aspects of the changes that occur under physiological conditions. Here we propose how site-specific cysteine photo-oxidation can be used to interrogate ensuing changes in protein structure and dynamics at atomic resolution. Although this powerful approach can connect cysteine covalent modification to global protein conformational changes and function, careful biochemical validation must accompany all such studies to exclude misleading artifacts. New types of X-ray crystallography experiments and powerful computational methods are creating new opportunities to connect conformational dynamics to catalysis for the large class of systems that use covalently modified cysteine residues for catalysis or regulation.},

We performed a systematic comparison on the quality of the protein crystals grown in sitting and hanging-drop methods using different crystallization plates: cross-diffusion microbatch plate (CDM SD: CDM plate, sitting drop method; CDM HD: CDM plate, hanging drop method), traditional sitting and hanging-drop vapor diffusion plates (T SD: traditional plate, sitting drop method; and T HD: traditional plate, hanging drop method).

The crystal quality was compared in terms of the resolution limit, mosaicity and Wilson plot B factor.

The application of high-fluency X-ray sources to large biomolecules has increased the importance of finding ways to curtail the onset of X-ray-induced damage. A significant effort has been under way with the aim of identifying strategies for protecting protein structure. A comprehensive model is presented that has the potential to explain, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the structural changes induced in crystalline protein at ∼100 K. The first step is to consider the qualitative question: what are the radiation-induced intermediates and expected end products? The aim of this paper is to assist in optimizing these strategies through a fundamental understanding of radiation physics and chemistry, with additional insight provided by theoretical calculations performed on the many schemes presented.},

abstract = {Parasites have been engineered to express fluorescent reporter proteins, yet the impact of red fluorescent proteins on Leishmania infections remains largely unknown. We analysed the infection outcome of Leishmania mexicana parasites engineered for the constitutive expression of mKate protein and evaluated their immunogenicity in BALB/c mice. Infection of BALB/c mice with mKate transfected L. mexicana (LmexmKate) parasites caused enlarged lesion sizes, leading to ulceration, and containing more parasites, as compared to LmexWT. The mKate protein showed immunogenic properties inducing antibody production against the mKate protein, as well as enhancing antibody production against the parasite. The augmented lesion sizes and ulcers, together with the more elevated antibody production, were related to an enhanced number of TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-1$\beta$ producing cells in the infected tissues. We conclude that mKate red fluorescent protein is an immunogenic protein, capable of modifying disease evolution of L. mexicana.},

The overall structure-solution workflow is similar for these techniques, but nuances exist because the properties of the reduced experimental data are different. Software tools for structure determination should therefore be tailored for each method. Phenix is a comprehensive software package for macromolecular structure determination that handles data from any of these techniques. Tasks performed with Phenix include data-quality assessment, map improvement, model building, the validation/rebuilding/refinement cycle and deposition. Each tool caters to the type of experimental data. The design of Phenix emphasizes the automation of procedures, where possible, to minimize repetitive and time-consuming manual tasks, while default parameters are chosen to encourage best practice. A graphical user interface provides access to many command-line features of Phenix and streamlines the transition between programs, project tracking and re-running of previous tasks.},

abstract = {An approach is demonstrated to obtain, in a sample- and time-efficient manner, multiple dose-resolved crystal structures from room-temperature protein microcrystals using identical fixed-target supports at both synchrotrons and X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs). This approach allows direct comparison of dose-resolved serial synchrotron and damage-free XFEL serial femtosecond crystallography structures of radiation-sensitive proteins. Specifically, serial synchrotron structures of a heme peroxidase enzyme reveal that X-ray induced changes occur at far lower doses than those at which diffraction quality is compromised (the Garman limit), consistent with previous studies on the reduction of heme proteins by low X-ray doses. In these structures, a functionally relevant bond length is shown to vary rapidly as a function of absorbed dose, with all room-temperature synchrotron structures exhibiting linear deformation of the active site compared with the XFEL structure. It is demonstrated that extrapolation of dose-dependent synchrotron structures to zero dose can closely approximate the damage-free XFEL structure. This approach is widely applicable to any protein where the crystal structure is altered by the synchrotron X-ray beam and provides a solution to the urgent requirement to determine intact structures of such proteins in a high-throughput and accessible manner.},

abstract = {Neutron protein crystallography (NPC) reveals the three-dimensional structures of proteins, including the positions of H atoms. The technique is particularly suited to elucidate ambiguous catalytic steps in complex biochemical reactions. While NPC uniquely complements biochemical assays and X-ray structural analyses by revealing the protonation states of ionizable groups at and around the active site of enzymes, the technique suffers from a major drawback: large single crystals must be grown to compensate for the relatively low flux of neutron beams. However, in addition to revealing the positions of hydrogens involved in enzyme catalysis, NPC has the advantage over X-ray crystallography that the crystals do not suffer radiation damage. The lack of radiation damage can be exploited to conduct in crystallo parametric studies. Here, the use of a single crystal of the small GTPase Ras to collect three neutron data sets at pD 8.4, 9.0 and 9.4 is reported, enabling an in crystallo titration study using NPC. In addition to revealing the behavior of titratable groups in the active site, the data sets will allow the analysis of allosteric water-mediated communication networks across the molecule, particularly regarding Cys118 and three tyrosine residues central to these networks, Tyr32, Tyr96 and Tyr137, with p K a values expected to be in the range sampled in our experiments.},

abstract = {Molecular replacement (MR) is the predominant route to solution of the phase problem in macromolecular crystallography. Where the lack of a suitable homologue precludes conventional MR, one option is to predict the target structure using bioinformatics. Such modelling, in the absence of homologous templates, is called ab initio or de novo modelling. Recently, the accuracy of such models has improved significantly as a result of the availability, in many cases, of residue-contact predictions derived from evolutionary covariance analysis. Covariance-assisted ab initio models representing structurally uncharacterized Pfam families are now available on a large scale in databases, potentially representing a valuable and easily accessible supplement to the PDB as a source of search models. Here, the unconventional MR pipeline AMPLE is employed to explore the value of structure predictions in the GREMLIN and PconsFam databases. It was tested whether these deposited predictions, processed in various ways, could solve the structures of PDB entries that were subsequently deposited. The results were encouraging: nine of 27 GREMLIN cases were solved, covering target lengths of 109–355 residues and a resolution range of 1.4–2.9 {\AA}, and with target–model shared sequence identity as low as 20%. The cluster-and-truncate approach in AMPLE proved to be essential for most successes. For the overall lower quality structure predictions in the PconsFam database, remodelling with Rosetta within the AMPLE pipeline proved to be the best approach, generating ensemble search models from single-structure deposits. Finally, it is shown that the AMPLE -obtained search models deriving from GREMLIN deposits are of sufficiently high quality to be selected by the sequence-independent MR pipeline SIMBAD . Overall, the results help to point the way towards the optimal use of the expanding databases of ab initio structure predictions.},

Here, a series of MX experiments are described which suggest that specific and global radiation damage are much less decoupled at room temperature than they are at cryogenic temperatures. The results reported here demonstrate the interest in reviving the practice of collecting MX diffraction data at room temperature and allow structural biologists to favourably envisage the development of time-resolved MX experiments at synchrotron sources.},

Although this is generally the case, several experimental and theoretical studies have indicated that structures from XFELs may not always be radiation-damage free. This is especially true when higher intensity pulses are used and protein molecules that contain heavy elements in their structures are studied.

Until recently, it was accepted that the third chromophore-forming residue in GFP-like proteins should be glycine, and efforts to replace it were in vain. Now, we have the first structure of a fluorescent protein with a successfully matured chromophore that has alanine as the third chromophore-forming residue. Consideration of the protein structures revealed two alternative routes of posttranslational transformation, resulting in either chromophore maturation or hydrolysis of GYG/GYA tripeptide. Both transformations are catalyzed by the same set of catalytic residues, Arg88 and Glu35–Wat–Glu211 cluster, whereas the residues in positions 62 and 102 shift the equilibrium between chromophore maturation and hydrolysis.},

abstract = {Radiation damage is the most fundamental limitation for achieving high resolution in electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) of biological samples. The effects of radiation damage are reduced by liquid-helium cooling, although the use of liquid helium is more challenging than that of liquid nitrogen. To date, the benefits of liquid-nitrogen and liquid-helium cooling for single-particle cryo-EM have not been compared quantitatively. With recent technical and computational advances in cryo-EM image recording and processing, such a comparison now seems timely. This study aims to evaluate the relative merits of liquid-helium cooling in present-day single-particle analysis, taking advantage of direct electron detectors. Two data sets for recombinant mouse heavy-chain apoferritin cooled with liquid-nitrogen or liquid-helium to 85 or 17 K were collected, processed and compared. No improvement in terms of resolution or Coulomb potential map quality was found for liquid-helium cooling. Interestingly, beam-induced motion was found to be significantly higher with liquid-helium cooling, especially within the most valuable first few frames of an exposure, thus counteracting any potential benefit of better cryoprotection that liquid-helium cooling may offer for single-particle cryo-EM.},

Protein crystals saturated with a pH sensitive dye, initially at one pH, can be exposed to the mother liquor at a second pH and the crystal will change color over time as H3O+ ions diffuse through the crystal. This allows diffusion rates of H3O+ through the crystal to be measured. Diffusion fronts are often clearly delineated. Similar experiments can be carried out with redox sensitive dyes by adding reductants, such as ascorbic acid or dithionite, or oxidants such as H2O2, to the crystal's mother liquor.

abstract = {Current software tools for the automated building of models for macromolecular X-ray crystal structures are capable of assembling high-quality models for ordered macromolecule and small-molecule scattering components with minimal or no user supervision. Many of these tools also incorporate robust functionality for modelling the ordered water molecules that are found in nearly all macromolecular crystal structures. However, no current tools focus on differentiating these ubiquitous water molecules from other frequently occurring multi-atom solvent species, such as sulfate, or the automated building of models for such species. PeakProbe has been developed specifically to address the need for such a tool. PeakProbe predicts likely solvent models for a given point (termed a `peak') in a structure based on analysis (`probing') of its local electron density and chemical environment. PeakProbe maps a total of 19 resolution-dependent features associated with electron density and two associated with the local chemical environment to a two-dimensional score space that is independent of resolution. Peaks are classified based on the relative frequencies with which four different classes of solvent (including water) are observed within a given region of this score space as determined by large-scale sampling of solvent models in the Protein Data Bank. Designed to classify peaks generated from difference density maxima, PeakProbe also incorporates functionality for identifying peaks associated with model errors or clusters of peaks likely to correspond to multi-atom solvent, and for the validation of existing solvent models using solvent-omit electron-density maps. When tasked with classifying peaks into one of four distinct solvent classes, PeakProbe achieves greater than 99% accuracy for both peaks derived directly from the atomic coordinates of existing solvent models and those based on difference density maxima. While the program is still under development, a fully functional version is publicly available. PeakProbe makes extensive use of cctbx libraries, and requires a PHENIX licence and an up-to-date phenix.python environment for execution.},

abstract = {Dissociation of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF$\beta$-1) from the inhibitory protein latency-associated peptide (LAP) can occur from low doses of X-ray irradiation of the LAP–TGF$\beta$-1 complex, resulting in the activation of TGF$\beta$-1, and can have health-related consequences. Using the tools and knowledge developed in the study of radiation damage in the crystallographic setting, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and complementary techniques suggest an activation process that is initiated but not driven by the initial X-ray exposure. LAP is revealed to be extended when not bound to TGF$\beta$-1 and has a different structural conformation compared to the bound state. These studies pave the way for the structural understanding of systems impacted at therapeutic X-ray doses and show the potential impact of radiation damage studies beyond their original intent.},

abstract = {With the continuing development of beamlines for macromolecular crystallography (MX) over the last few years providing ever higher X-ray flux densities, it has become even more important to be aware of the effects of radiation damage on the resulting structures. Nine papers in this issue cover a range of aspects related to the physics and chemistry of the manifestations of this damage, as observed in both MX and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) on crystals, solutions and tissue samples. The reports include measurements of the heating caused by X-ray irradiation in ruby microcrystals, low-dose experiments examining damage rates as a function of incident X-ray energy up to 30 keV on a metallo-enzyme using a CdTe detector of high quantum efficiency as well as a theoretical analysis of the gains predicted in diffraction efficiency using these detectors, a SAXS examination of low-dose radiation exposure effects on the dissociation of a protein complex related to human health, theoretical calculations describing radiation chemistry pathways which aim to explain the specific structural damage widely observed in proteins, investigation of radiation-induced damage effects in a DNA crystal, a case study on a metallo-enzyme where structural movements thought to be mechanism related might actually be radiation-damage-induced changes, and finally a review describing what X-ray radiation-induced cysteine modifications can teach us about protein dynamics and catalysis. These papers, along with some other relevant literature published since the last Journal of Synchrotron Radiation Radiation Damage special issue in 2017, are briefly summarized below.},

abstract = {Validation of three-dimensional structures is at the core of structural determination methods. The local validation criteria, such as deviations from ideal bond length and bonding angles, Ramachandran plot outliers and clashing contacts, are a standard part of structure analysis before structure deposition, whereas the global and regional packing may not yet have been addressed. In the last two decades, three-dimensional models of macromolecules such as proteins have been successfully described by a network of nodes and edges. Amino acid residues as nodes and close contact between the residues as edges have been used to explore basic network properties, to study protein folding and stability and to predict catalytic sites. Using complex network analysis, we introduced common network parameters to distinguish between correct and incorrect three-dimensional protein structures. The analysis showed that correct structures have a higher average node degree, higher graph energy, and lower shortest path length than their incorrect counterparts. Thus, correct protein models are more densely intra-connected, and in turn, the transfer of information between nodes/amino acids is more efficient. Moreover, protein graph spectra were used to investigate model bias in protein structure.},

abstract = {Using X-ray energies higher than those normally used (5–15 keV) for macromolecular X-ray crystallography (MX) at synchrotron sources can theoretically increase the achievable signal as a function of dose and reduce the rate of radiation damage. In practice, a major stumbling block to the use of higher X-ray energy has been the reduced quantum efficiency of silicon detectors as the X-ray energy increases, but hybrid photon-counting CdTe detectors are optimized for higher X-ray energies, and their performance has been steadily improving. Here the potential advantages of using higher incident beam energy together with a CdTe detector for MX are explored, with a particular focus on the advantages that higher beam energies may have for MX experiments with microbeams or microcrystals. Monte Carlo simulations are presented here which for the first time include the efficiency responses of some available X-ray detectors, as well as the possible escape of photoelectrons from the sample and their entry from surrounding material. The results reveal a `sweet spot' at an incident X-ray energy of 26 keV, and show a greater than factor of two improvement in diffraction efficiency at this energy when using microbeams and microcrystals of 5 µm or less.},

abstract = {Xylose isomerase (XI) is an industrially important metalloprotein studied for decades. Its reaction mechanism has been postulated to involve movement of the catalytic metal cofactor to several different conformations. Here, a dose-dependent approach was used to investigate the radiation damage effects on XI and their potential influence on the reaction mechanism interpreted from the X-ray derived structures. Radiation damage is still one of the major challenges for X-ray diffraction experiments and causes both global and site-specific damage. In this study, consecutive high-resolution data sets from a single XI crystal from the same wedge were collected at 100 K and the progression of radiation damage was tracked over increasing dose (0.13–3.88 MGy). The catalytic metal and its surrounding amino acid environment experience a build-up of free radicals, and the results show radiation-damage-induced structural perturbations ranging from an absolute metal positional shift to specific residue motions in the active site. The apparent metal movement is an artefact of global damage and the resulting unit-cell expansion, but residue motion appears to be driven by the dose. Understanding and identifying radiation-induced damage is an important factor in accurately interpreting the biological conclusions being drawn.},

abstract = {Low-frequency vibrations are crucial for protein structure and function, but only a few experimental techniques can shine light on them. The main challenge when addressing protein dynamics in the terahertz domain is the ubiquitous water that exhibit strong absorption. In this paper, we observe the protein atoms directly using X-ray crystallography in bovine trypsin at 100 K while irradiating the crystals with 0.5 THz radiation alternating on and off states. We observed that the anisotropy of atomic displacements increased upon terahertz irradiation. Atomic displacement similarities developed between chemically related atoms and between atoms of the catalytic machinery. This pattern likely arises from delocalized polar vibrational modes rather than delocalized elastic deformations or rigid-body displacements. The displacement correlation between these atoms were detected by a hierarchical clustering method, which can assist the analysis of other ultra-high resolution crystal structures. These experimental and analytical tools provide a detailed description of protein dynamics to complement the structural information from static diffraction experiments.},

The traditional approaches for diffraction data collection have emphasised collecting data from noisy integrating detectors ( i.e. film, image plates and CCD detectors). With fast pixel array detectors on stable beamlines, the limiting factor becomes the sample lifetime, and the question becomes one of how to expend the photons that your sample can diffract, i.e. as a smaller number of stronger measurements or a larger number of weaker data. This parameter space is explored via experiment and synthetic data treatment and advice is derived on how best to use the equipment on a modern beamline. Suggestions are also made on how to acquire data in a conservative manner if very little is known about the sample lifetime.},

abstract = {Engagement of an extended $\beta$-sheet is a common substrate/inhibitor interaction at the active site of serine proteases and is an important feature of Laskowski mechanism inhibitors that present a substrate-like loop to a target protease. This loop is cleaved but subsequently relegated forming a stable inhibitor/protease complex. Laskowski inhibitors are ubiquitous in nature and are used extensively in serine protease inhibitor design. However, most studies concentrate on introducing new sidechain interactions rather than the direct contributions of the substrate-like $\beta$-sheet to enzyme inhibition. Here we report the crystal structure of an simplified $\beta$-sheet inhibitory motif within the Sunflower Trypsin Inhibitor (SFTI) in complex with trypsin. We show that the intramolecular hydrogen bond network of this SFTI variant (SFTI-TCTR) engages the inhibitor sidechains that would normally interact with a target protease, giving mainchain interactions a more prominent role in complex formation. Despite having reduced sidechain interactions, this SFTI variant is remarkably potent and inhibits a diverse range of serine proteases. Crystal structural analysis and molecular modelling of SFTI-TCTR complexes again indicates an interface dominated by $\beta$–sheet interactions, highlighting the importance of this motif and the adaptability of SFTI as a scaffold for inhibitor design.},

abstract = {Traditionally small-molecule crystallographers have not usually observed or recognized significant radiation damage to their samples during diffraction experiments. However, the increased flux densities provided by third-generation synchrotrons have resulted in increasing numbers of observations of this phenomenon. The diversity of types of small-molecule systems means it is not yet possible to propose a general mechanism for their radiation-induced sample decay, however characterization of the effects will permit attempts to understand and mitigate it. Here, systematic experiments are reported on the effects that sample temperature and beam attenuation have on radiation damage progression, allowing qualitative and quantitative assessment of their impact on crystals of a small-molecule test sample. To allow inter-comparison of different measurements, radiation-damage metrics (diffraction-intensity decline, resolution fall-off, scaling B -factor increase) are plotted against the absorbed dose. For ease-of-dose calculations, the software developed for protein crystallography, RADDOSE -3 D , has been modified for use in small-molecule crystallography. It is intended that these initial experiments will assist in establishing protocols for small-molecule crystallographers to optimize the diffraction signal from their samples prior to the onset of the deleterious effects of radiation damage.},

abstract = {In macromolecular crystallography, a great deal of effort has been invested in understanding radiation-damage progression. While the sensitivity of protein crystals has been well characterized, crystals of DNA and of DNA–protein complexes have not thus far been studied as thoroughly. Here, a systematic investigation of radiation damage to a crystal of a DNA 16-mer diffracting to 1.8 {\AA} resolution and held at 100 K, up to an absorbed dose of 45 MGy, is reported. The RIDL ( Radiation-Induced Density Loss ) automated computational tool was used for electron-density analysis. Both the global and specific damage to the DNA crystal as a function of dose were monitored, following careful calibration of the X-ray flux and beam profile. The DNA crystal was found to be fairly radiation insensitive to both global and specific damage, with half of the initial diffraction intensity being lost at an absorbed average diffraction-weighted dose, D 1/2 , of 19 MGy, compared with 9 MGy for chicken egg-white lysozyme crystals under the same beam conditions but at the higher resolution of 1.4 {\AA}. The coefficient of sensitivity of the DNA crystal was 0.014 {\AA} 2 MGy −1 , which is similar to that observed for proteins. These results imply that the significantly greater radiation hardness of DNA and RNA compared with protein observed in a DNA–protein complex and an RNA–protein complex could be due to scavenging action by the protein, thereby protecting the DNA and RNA in these studies. In terms of specific damage, the regions of DNA that were found to be sensitive were those associated with some of the bound calcium ions sequestered from the crystallization buffer. In contrast, moieties farther from these sites showed only small changes even at higher doses.},

abstract = {Background: Escherichia coli W3110 and a group of six isogenic derivatives, each displaying distinct specific rates of glucose consumption were characterized to determine levels of GFP production and population heterogeneity. These strains have single or combinatory deletions in genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) permeases as PtsG and ManX, as well as common components EI, Hpr protein and EIIA, also the non-PTS Mgl galactose/glucose ABC transporter. They have been transformed for expressing GFP based on a lac-based expression vector, which is subject to bistability. Results: These strains displayed specific glucose consumption and growth rates ranging from 1.75 to 0.45 g/g h and 0.54 to 0.16 h-1, respectively. The rate of acetate production was strongly reduced in all mutant strains when compared with W3110/pV21. In bioreactor cultures, wild type W3110/pV21 produced 50.51 mg/L GFP, whereas strains WG/pV21 with inactive PTS IICBGlc and WGM/pV21 with the additional inactivation of PTS IIABMan showed the highest titers of GFP, corresponding to 342 and 438 mg/L, respectively. Moreover, we showed experimentally that bistable expression systems, as lac-based ones, induce strong phenotypic segregation among microbial populations. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that reduction on glucose consumption rate in E. coli leads to an improvement of GFP production. Furthermore, from the perspective of phenotypic heterogeneity, we observed in this case that heterogeneous systems are also the ones leading to the highest performance. This observation suggests reconsidering the generally accepted proposition stating that phenotypic heterogeneity is generally unwanted in bioprocess applications.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]},

abstract = {Natural inhibitors of proteases have been classified into different families, among them is the Bowman-Birk Inhibitor (BBI) family. Members of BBI have two structurally reactive loops that simultaneously inhibit trypsin and chymotrypsin. Here, we have investigated the binding of bovine trypsin by a cyclic nonapeptide, named PTRY9 (CTKSIPPQC), derived of the black-eyed pea trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibitor (BTCI) from Vigna unguiculata seeds. This peptide was synthetically produced with the disulfide bond restraining its conformation to mimic the reactive loop that inhibits trypsin. PTRY9 complexed to pancreatic bovine trypsin was crystallized in orthorhombic and trigonal space groups, P2 1 2 1 2 1 and P3 2 21, with maximum resolutions of 1.15 and 1.61 {\AA} respectively. The structures presented refinement parameters of R work = 14.52 % and R free = 15.59 %; R work = 15.60 % and R free = 18.78 %, and different surface area between the peptide and the enzyme of 1024 {\AA} 2 and 1070 {\AA} 2 , respectively. The binding site of the PTRY9 is similar to that found for BTCI as shown by a r.m.s.d. of 0.358 {\AA} between the superimposed structures and the electrostatic complementary pattern at the enzyme-peptide interface. Additionally, enzyme inhibition assays show that the affinity of trypsin for PTRY9 is smaller than that for BTCI. In vitro assays revealed that, like BTCI, this synthetic peptide is not cytotoxic for normal mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells, but exerts cytotoxic effects on MDA.MB.231 invasive human breast cancer cells.},

abstract = {Native single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) is the most attractive de novo phasing method in macromolecular crystallography, as it directly utilizes intrinsic anomalous scattering from native crystals. However, the success of such an experiment depends on accurate measurements of the reflection intensities and therefore on careful data-collection protocols. Here, the low-dose, multiple-orientation data-collection protocol for native SAD phasing developed at beamline X06DA (PXIII) at the Swiss Light Source is reviewed, and its usage over the last four years on conventional crystals (>50 µm) is reported. Being experimentally very simple and fast, this method has gained popularity and has delivered 45 de novo structures to date (13 of which have been published). Native SAD is currently the primary choice for experimental phasing among X06DA users. The method can address challenging cases: here, native SAD phasing performed on a streptavidin–biotin crystal with P 2 1 symmetry and a low Bijvoet ratio of 0.6% is highlighted. The use of intrinsic anomalous signals as sequence markers for model building and the assignment of ions is also briefly described.},

The development of the X-ray free-electron laser has opened the path toward high resolution single particle imaging, and the extreme intensity of the X-rays ensures that enough diffraction statistics are collected before the sample is destroyed by radiation damage. Still, recovery of the structure is a challenge, in part due to the partial fragmentation of the sample during the diffraction event. In this study, we use first-principles based methods to study the impact of radiation induced ionization of six amino acids on the reconstruction process. In particular, we study the fragmentation and charge rearrangement to elucidate the time scales involved and the characteristic fragments occurring.},

abstract = {Copper-containing nitrite reductases (CuNiRs) that convert NO 2 − to NO via a Cu CAT –His–Cys–Cu ET proton-coupled redox system are of central importance in nitrogen-based energy metabolism. These metalloenzymes, like all redox enzymes, are very susceptible to radiation damage from the intense synchrotron-radiation X-rays that are used to obtain structures at high resolution. Understanding the chemistry that underpins the enzyme mechanisms in these systems requires resolutions of better than 2 {\AA}. Here, for the first time, the damage-free structure of the resting state of one of the most studied CuNiRs was obtained by combining X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) and neutron crystallography. This represents the first direct comparison of neutron and XFEL structural data for any protein. In addition, damage-free structures of the reduced and nitrite-bound forms have been obtained to high resolution from cryogenically maintained crystals by XFEL crystallography. It is demonstrated that Asp CAT and His CAT are deprotonated in the resting state of CuNiRs at pH values close to the optimum for activity. A bridging neutral water (D 2 O) is positioned with one deuteron directed towards Asp CAT O $\delta$1 and one towards His CAT N ∊2 . The catalytic T2Cu-ligated water (W1) can clearly be modelled as a neutral D 2 O molecule as opposed to D 3 O + or OD − , which have previously been suggested as possible alternatives. The bridging water restricts the movement of the unprotonated Asp CAT and is too distant to form a hydrogen bond to the O atom of the bound nitrite that interacts with Asp CAT . Upon the binding of NO 2 − a proton is transferred from the bridging water to the O $\delta$2 atom of Asp CAT , prompting electron transfer from T1Cu to T2Cu and reducing the catalytic redox centre. This triggers the transfer of a proton from Asp CAT to the bound nitrite, enabling the reaction to proceed.},

abstract = {Plasma kallikrein (pKal) is a serine protease responsible for cleaving high-molecular-weight kininogen to produce the pro-inflammatory peptide, bradykinin. Unregulated pKal activity can lead to hereditary angioedema (HAE) following excess bradykinin release. HAE attacks can lead to a compromised airway that can be life threatening. As there are limited agents for prophylaxis of HAE attacks, there is a high unmet need for a therapeutic agent for regulating pKal with a high degree of specificity. Here we present crystal structures of both full-length and the protease domain of pKal, bound to two very distinct classes of small-molecule inhibitors: compound 1, and BCX4161. Both inhibitors demonstrate low nM inhibitory potency for pKal and varying specificity for related serine proteases. Compound 1 utilizes a surprising mode of interaction and upon binding results in a rearrangement of the binding pocket. Co-crystal structures of pKal describes why this class of small-molecule inhibitor is potent. Lack of conservation in surrounding residues explains the ∼10,000-fold specificity over structurally similar proteases, as shown by in vitro protease inhibition data. Structural information, combined with biochemical and enzymatic analyses, provides a novel scaffold for the design of targeted oral small molecule inhibitors of pKal for treatment of HAE and other diseases resulting from unregulated plasma kallikrein activity.},

However, cryocooling of crystals and X-ray radiation damage may distort the observed ligand binding. Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) using X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) can produce radiation-damage-free room-temperature structures. Ligand-binding studies using SFX have received only modest attention, partly owing to limited beamtime availability and the large quantity of sample that is required per structure determination. Here, a high-throughput approach to determine room-temperature damage-free structures with excellent sample and time efficiency is demonstrated, allowing complexes to be characterized rapidly and without prohibitive sample requirements. This yields high-quality difference density maps allowing unambiguous ligand placement. Crucially, it is demonstrated that ligands similar in size or smaller than those used in fragment-based drug design may be clearly identified in data sets obtained from <1000 diffraction images. This efficiency in both sample and XFEL beamtime opens the door to true high-throughput screening of protein–ligand complexes using SFX.},

abstract = {The local Fourier-space relation between diffracted intensity I , diffraction wavevector q and dose D , \tilde I(q,D), is key to probing and understanding radiation damage by X-rays and energetic particles in both diffraction and imaging experiments. The models used in protein crystallography for the last 50 years provide good fits to experimental I ( q ) versus nominal dose data, but have unclear physical significance. More recently, a fit to diffraction and imaging experiments suggested that the maximum tolerable dose varies as q −1 or linearly with resolution. Here, it is shown that crystallographic data have been strongly perturbed by the effects of spatially nonuniform crystal irradiation and diffraction during data collection. Reanalysis shows that these data are consistent with a purely exponential local dose dependence, \tilde I(q,D) = I 0 ( q )exp[− D / D e ( q )], where D e ( q ) ∝ q $\alpha$ with $\alpha$ ≃ 1.7. A physics-based model for radiation damage, in which damage events occurring at random locations within a sample each cause energy deposition and blurring of the electron density within a small volume, predicts this exponential variation with dose for all q values and a decay exponent $\alpha$ ≃ 2 in two and three dimensions, roughly consistent with both diffraction and imaging experiments over more than two orders of magnitude in resolution. The B -factor model used to account for radiation damage in crystallographic scaling programs is consistent with $\alpha$ = 2, but may not accurately capture the dose dependencies of structure factors under typical nonuniform illumination conditions. The strong q dependence of radiation-induced diffraction decays implies that the previously proposed 20–30 MGy dose limit for protein crystallography should be replaced by a resolution-dependent dose limit that, for atomic resolution data sets, will be much smaller. The results suggest that the physics underlying basic experimental trends in radiation damage at T ≃ 100 K is straightforward and universal. Deviations of the local I ( q , D ) from strictly exponential behavior may provide mechanistic insights, especially into the radiation-damage processes responsible for the greatly increased radiation sensitivity observed at T ≃ 300 K.},

abstract = {For macromolecular structure determination at synchrotron sources, radiation damage remains a major limiting factor. Estimation of the absorbed dose (J kg −1 ) during data collection at these sources by programs such as RADDOSE-3D has allowed direct comparison of radiation damage between experiments carried out with different samples and beam parameters. This has enabled prediction of roughly when radiation damage will manifest so it can potentially be avoided. X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), which produce intense X-ray pulses only a few femtoseconds in duration, can be used to generate diffraction patterns before most of the radiation damage processes have occurred and hence hypothetically they enable the determination of damage-free atomic resolution structures. In spite of this, several experimental and theoretical studies have suggested that structures from XFELs are not always free of radiation damage. There are currently no freely available programs designed to calculate the dose absorbed during XFEL data collection. This article presents an extension to RADDOSE-3D called RADDOSE-XFEL , which calculates the time-resolved dose during XFEL experiments. It is anticipated that RADDOSE-XFEL could be used to facilitate the study of radiation damage at XFELs and ultimately be used prior to data collection so that experimenters can plan their experiments to avoid radiation damage manifesting in their structures.},

abstract = {Good prior estimates of the effective root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between the atomic coordinates of the model and the target optimize the signal in molecular replacement, thereby increasing the success rate in difficult cases. Previous studies using protein structures solved by X-ray crystallography as models showed that optimal error estimates (refined after structure solution) were correlated with the sequence identity between the model and target, and with the number of residues in the model. Here, this work has been extended to find additional correlations between parameters of the model and the target and hence improved prior estimates of the coordinate error. Using a graph database, a curated set of 6030 molecular-replacement calculations using models that had been solved by X-ray crystallography was analysed to consider about 120 model and target parameters. Improved estimates were achieved by replacing the sequence identity with the Gonnet score for sequence similarity, as well as by considering the resolution of the target structure and the MolProbity score of the model. This approach was extended by analysing 12 610 additional molecular-replacement calculations where the model was determined by NMR. The median r.m.s.d. between pairs of models in an ensemble was found to be correlated with the estimated r.m.s.d. to the target. For models solved by NMR, the overall coordinate error estimates were larger than for structures determined by X-ray crystallography, and were more highly correlated with the number of residues.},

abstract = {The accuracy of detecting protein crystals for fluorescence microscopy images is very critical for high throughput and automated systems. Although the trace fluorescent labeling method could highlight protein crystals, reflection and emission from the fluorescence dye is not always due to crystal regions. Therefore, the analysis of the peak wavelength in the emission spectra of a fluorophore may not always yield effective results. In this paper, we show that using the subordinate color intensity corresponding to longer wavelengths than the peak wavelength of the emission spectra could improve the accuracy of protein crystal detection. Hence, we have built a segmentation method based on the percentile intensity of the subordinate color for trace fluorescently labeled (TFL'd) protein crystallization trial images. Compared to using the dominant color channel, our segmentation method on subordinate color channel was able to reduce the misclassification rate of likely-leads or crystals as non-crystals by the percentage of from 9.71% to 2.02% depending on the classifier. Similarly, the accuracy of classifiers were increased by the percentage of from 1.77% to 5.53%. Our method reached around 94% accuracy while keeping misclassification of likely-leads and crystals as non-crystals below 1%. Moreover, to evaluate the generalizability of our method, we have conducted new wet lab experiments on two proteins, Concanavalin A (Con A) and Ab inorganic pyrophosphate (AbIPPase), and the misclassification rate was below 1%. Our experiments show that using the subordinate channel may be more helpful for TFL'd protein trial image classification.},

The extreme intensity of X-ray pulses can potentially cause significant modifications to the sample structure during exposure. Successful time-resolved XFEL crystallography depends on the unambiguous interpretation of the protein dynamics of interest from the effects of radiation damage. Proteins containing relatively heavy elements, such as sulfur or metals, have a higher risk for radiation damage. In metaloenzymes, for example, the dynamics of interest usually occur at the metal centers, which are also hotspots for damage due to the higher atomic number of the elements they contain. An ongoing challenge with such local damage is to understand the residual bonding in these locally ionized systems and bond-breaking dynamics. Here, we present a perspective on radiation damage in XFEL experiments with a particular focus on the impacts for time-resolved protein crystallography.

The conditional distributions take into account various types of prior information: in the rotation step the prior information may concern a non-oriented model molecule alone or together with one or more located model molecules. The formulae thus obtained are used to derive figures of merit for recognizing the correct orientation in the rotation step and the correct location in the translation step. The phases obtained by this new version of REMO 09 are used as a starting point for a pipeline which in its first step extends and refines the molecular-replacement phases, and in its second step creates the final electron-density map which is automatically interpreted by CAB , an automatic model-building program for proteins and DNA/RNA structures.},

abstract = {Density modification uses expectations about features of a map such as a flat solvent and expected distributions of density in the region of the macromolecule to improve individual Fourier terms representing the map. This process transfers information from one part of a map to another and can improve the accuracy of a map. Here, the assumptions behind density modification for maps from electron cryomicroscopy are examined and a procedure is presented that allows the incorporation of model-based information. Density modification works best in cases where unfiltered, unmasked maps with clear boundaries between the macromolecule and solvent are visible, and where there is substantial noise in the map, both in the region of the macromolecule and the solvent. It also is most effective if the characteristics of the map are relatively constant within regions of the macromolecule and the solvent. Model-based information can be used to improve density modification, but model bias can in principle occur. Here, model bias is reduced by using ensemble models that allow an estimation of model uncertainty. A test of model bias is presented that suggests that even if the expected density in a region of a map is specified incorrectly by using an incorrect model, the incorrect expectations do not strongly affect the final map.},

abstract = {Traditional X-ray diffraction data collected at cryo-temperatures have delivered invaluable insights into the three-dimensional structures of proteins, providing the backbone of structure–function studies. While cryo-cooling mitigates radiation damage, cryo-temperatures can alter protein conformational ensembles and solvent structure. Furthermore, conformational ensembles underlie protein function and energetics, and recent advances in room-temperature X-ray crystallography have delivered conformational heterogeneity information that can be directly related to biological function. Given this capability, the next challenge is to develop a robust and broadly applicable method to collect single-crystal X-ray diffraction data at and above room temperature. This challenge is addressed herein. The approach described provides complete diffraction data sets with total collection times as short as ∼5 s from single protein crystals, dramatically increasing the quantity of data that can be collected within allocated synchrotron beam time. Its applicability was demonstrated by collecting 1.09–1.54 {\AA} resolution data over a temperature range of 293–363 K for proteinase K, thaumatin and lysozyme crystals at BL14-1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource. The analyses presented here indicate that the diffraction data are of high quality and do not suffer from excessive dehydration or radiation damage.},

Despite many X-ray crystallographic studies, the reaction mechanism of copper-containing nitrite reductases (CuNIRs), which reduce nitrite using two protons, has been controversial. The high-resolution neutron structure of a CuNIR reveals the protonation states of catalytic residues and key water molecules, thus providing insights into the catalytic mechanism. The catalytic Cu is shown to be coordinated by a hydroxide ion and not water. Furthermore, the hydrogen-deuterium exchange ratio suggests that intramolecular electron transfer is involved in a hydrogen-bond jump. These observations are consistent with previous computational chemistry; therefore, our study forms a bridge between the structural biology and quantum chemistry of CuNIRs.},

abstract = {Manually identifying and correcting errors in protein models can be a slow process, but improvements in validation tools and automated model-building software can contribute to reducing this burden. This article presents a new correctness score that is produced by combining multiple sources of information using a neural network. The residues in 639 automatically built models were marked as correct or incorrect by comparing them with the coordinates deposited in the PDB. A number of features were also calculated for each residue using Coot , including map-to-model correlation, density values, B factors, clashes, Ramachandran scores, rotamer scores and resolution. Two neural networks were created using these features as inputs: one to predict the correctness of main-chain atoms and the other for side chains. The 639 structures were split into 511 that were used to train the neural networks and 128 that were used to test performance. The predicted correctness scores could correctly categorize 92.3% of the main-chain atoms and 87.6% of the side chains. A Coot ML Correctness script was written to display the scores in a graphical user interface as well as for the automatic pruning of chains, residues and side chains with low scores. The automatic pruning function was added to the CCP 4 i 2 Buccaneer automated model-building pipeline, leading to significant improvements, especially for high-resolution structures.},

abstract = {Trypsin and thrombin, structurally similar serine proteases, recognize different substrates; thrombin cleaves after Arg, whereas trypsin cleaves after Lys/Arg. Both recognize basic substrate headgroups via Asp189 at the bottom of the S1 pocket. By crystallography and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we studied a series of d-Phe/d-DiPhe-Pro-(amino)pyridines. Identical ligand pairs show the same binding poses. Surprisingly, one ligand binds to trypsin in protonated state and to thrombin in unprotonated state at P1 along with differences in the residual solvation pattern. While trypsin binding is mediated by an ordered water molecule, in thrombin, water is scattered over three hydration sites. Although having highly similar S1 pockets, our results suggest different electrostatic properties of Asp189 possibly contributing to the selectivity determinant. Thrombin binds a specific Na+ ion next to Asp189, which is absent in trypsin. The electrostatic properties across the S1 pocket are further attenuated by charged Glu192 at the rim of S1 in thrombin, which is replaced by uncharged Gln192 in trypsin.},

abstract = {Radiation-induced damage to protein crystals during X-ray diffraction data collection is a major impediment to obtaining accurate structural information on macromolecules. Some of the specific impairments that are inflicted upon highly brilliant X-ray irradiation are metal-ion reduction, disulfide-bond cleavage and a loss of the integrity of the carboxyl groups of acidic residues. With respect to disulfide-bond reduction, previous results have indicated that not all disulfide bridges are equally susceptible to damage. A careful analysis of the chemical environment of disulfide bonds in the structures of elastase, lysozyme, acetylcholinesterase and other proteins suggests that S—S bonds which engage in a close contact with a carbonyl O atom along the extension of the S—S bond vector are more susceptible to reduction than the others. Such an arrangement predisposes electron transfer to occur from the O atom to the disulfide bond, leading to its reduction. The interaction between a nucleophile and an electrophile, akin to hydrogen bonding, stabilizes protein structures, but it also provides a pathway of electron transfer to the S—S bond, leading to its reduction during exposure of the protein crystal to an intense X-ray beam. An otherwise stabilizing interaction can thus be the cause of destabilization under the condition of radiation exposure.},

abstract = {A significant problem in biological X-ray crystallography is the radiation chemistry caused by the incident X-ray beam. This produces both global and site-specific damage. Site specific damage can misdirect the biological interpretation of the structural models produced. Cryo-cooling crystals has been successful in mitigating damage but not eliminating it altogether; however, cryo-cooling can be difficult in some cases and has also been shown to limit functionally relevant protein conformations. The doses used for X-ray crystallography are typically in the kilo-gray to mega-gray range. While disulfide bonds are among the most significantly affected species in proteins in the crystalline state at both cryogenic and higher temperatures, there is limited information on their response to low X-ray doses in solution, the details of which might inform biomedical applications of X-rays. In this work we engineered a protein that dimerizes through a susceptible disulfide bond to relate the radiation damage processes seen in cryo-cooled crystals to those closer to physiologic conditions. This approach enables a low-resolution technique, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), to detect and monitor a residue specific process. A dose dependent fragmentation of the engineered protein was seen that can be explained by a dimer to monomer transition through disulfide bond cleavage. This supports the crystallographically derived mechanism and demonstrates that results obtained crystallographically can be usefully extrapolated to physiologic conditions. Fragmentation was influenced by pH and the conformation of the dimer, providing information on mechanism and pointing to future routes for investigation and potential mitigation. The novel engineered protein approach to generate a large-scale change through a site-specific interaction represents a promising tool for advancing radiation damage studies under solution conditions.},

The same wedge of reciprocal space was recorded twice by continuous-rotation MicroED from a set of 11 individual crystals. The data from the first pass were merged to make a “low-dose dataset.” The data from the second pass were similarly merged to form a “damaged dataset.” Differences between these two datasets were used to identify a single heavy-atom site from a Patterson difference map, and initial phases were generated. Finally, the structure was completed by iterative cycles of modeling and refinement. Demonstration of experimental phasing with the cryoEM method MicroED.

Scaling corrects for effects such as changes in sample illumination, absorption and, to some extent, global radiation damage that cause the measured intensities of symmetry-equivalent observations to differ throughout a data set. This necessarily requires a prior evaluation of the point-group symmetry of the crystal. This paper describes and evaluates the scaling algorithms implemented within the DIALS data-processing package and demonstrates the effectiveness and key features of the implementation on example macromolecular crystallographic rotation data. In particular, the scaling algorithms enable new workflows for the scaling of multi-crystal or multi-sweep data sets, providing the analysis required to support current trends towards collecting data from ever-smaller samples. In addition, the implementation of a free-set validation method is discussed, which allows the quantification of the suitability of scaling-model and algorithm choices.},

abstract = {The performance of automated protein model building usually decreases with resolution, mainly owing to the lower information content of the experimental data. This calls for a more elaborate use of the available structural information about macromolecules. Here, a new method is presented that uses structural homologues to improve the quality of protein models automatically constructed using ARP / wARP . The method uses local structural similarity between deposited models and the model being built, and results in longer main-chain fragments that in turn can be more reliably docked to the protein sequence. The application of the homology-based model extension method to the example of a CFA synthase at 2.7 {\AA} resolution resulted in a more complete model with almost all of the residues correctly built and docked to the sequence. The method was also evaluated on 1493 molecular-replacement solutions at a resolution of 4.0 {\AA} and better that were submitted to the ARP / wARP web service for model building. A significant improvement in the completeness and sequence coverage of the built models has been observed.},

However, investigation of this motif as a disulfide mimetic in cyclic peptides has been limited, and the structural consequences remain to be studied. We report synthetic strategies to install various triazole linkages into cyclic peptides through backbone cyclisation and RuAAC cross-linking reactions. These linkages were evaluated in four serine protease inhibitors based on sunflower trypsin inhibitor-1. NMR and X-ray crystallography revealed exceptional consensus of bridging distance and backbone conformations (RMSD<0.5 {\AA}) of the triazole linkages compared to the parent disulfide molecules. The triazole-bridged peptides also displayed superior half-lives in liver S9 stability assays compared to disulfide-bridged peptides.

abstract = {Serial X-ray crystallography at free-electron lasers allows to solve biomolecular structures from sub-micron-sized crystals. However, beam time at these facilities is scarce, and involved sample delivery techniques are required. On the other hand, rotation electron diffraction (MicroED) has shown great potential as an alternative means for protein nano-crystallography. Here, we present a method for serial electron diffraction of protein nanocrystals combining the benefits of both approaches. In a scanning transmission electron microscope, crystals randomly dispersed on a sample grid are automatically mapped, and a diffraction pattern at fixed orientation is recorded from each at a high acquisition rate. Dose fractionation ensures minimal radiation damage effects. We demonstrate the method by solving the structure of granulovirus occlusion bodies and lysozyme to resolutions of 1.55 {\AA} and 1.80 {\AA}, respectively. Our method promises to provide rapid structure determination for many classes of materials with minimal sample consumption, using readily available instrumentation.},

abstract = {The information gained by making a measurement, termed the Kullback-Leibler divergence, assesses how much more precisely the true quantity is known after the measurement was made (the posterior probability distribution) than before (the prior probability distribution). It provides an upper bound for the contribution that an observation can make to the total likelihood score in likelihood-based crystallographic algorithms. This makes information gain a natural criterion for deciding which data can legitimately be omitted from likelihood calculations. Many existing methods use an approximation for the effects of measurement error that breaks down for very weak and poorly measured data. For such methods a different (higher) information threshold is appropriate compared with methods that account well for even large measurement errors. Concerns are raised about a current trend to deposit data that have been corrected for anisotropy, sharpened and pruned without including the original unaltered measurements. If not checked, this trend will have serious consequences for the reuse of deposited data by those who hope to repeat calculations using improved new methods.},

abstract = {Fragment-based molecular replacement exploits the use of very accurate yet incomplete search models. In the case of the ARCIMBOLDO programs, consistent phase sets produced from the placement and refinement of fragments with Phaser can be combined in order to increase their signal before proceeding to the step of density modification and autotracing with SHELXE . The program ALIXE compares multiple phase sets, evaluating mean phase differences to determine their common origin, and subsequently produces sets of combined phases that group consistent solutions. In this work, its use on different scenarios of very partial molecular-replacement solutions and its performance after the development of a much-optimized set of algorithms are described. The program is available both standalone and integrated within the ARCIMBOLDO programs. ALIXE has been analysed to identify its rate-limiting steps while exploring the best parameterization to improve its performance and make this software efficient enough to work on modest hardware. The algorithm has been parallelized and redesigned to meet the typical landscape of solutions. Analysis of pairwise correlation between the phase sets has also been explored to test whether this would provide additional insight. ALIXE can be used to exhaustively analyse all partial solutions produced or to complement those already selected for expansion, and also to reduce the number of redundant solutions, which is particularly relevant to the case of coiled coils, or to combine partial solutions from different programs. In each case parallelization and optimization to provide speedup makes its use amenable to typical hardware found in crystallography.

However, the description of molecular flexibility is instrinsically flawed and in almost all cases, regardless of the experimental method used for structure determination, there remains a strong overfitting bias during molecular model building and refinement. In the worst case this can lead to wholly incorrect structures and thus incorrect biological interpretations. Here, by reparametrizing the description of these complex structures in terms of bonds rather than atomic positions, and by modelling flexibility using a deterministic ensemble of structures, it is demonstrated that structures can be described using fewer parameters than in conventional refinement. The current implementation, applied to X-ray diffraction data, significantly reduces the extent of overfitting, allowing the experimental data to reveal more biological information in electron-density maps.},

abstract = {The functions of most proteins result from their 3D structures, but determining their structures experimentally remains a challenge, despite steady advances in crystallography, NMR and single-particle cryoEM. Computationally predicting the structure of a protein from its primary sequence has long been a grand challenge in bioinformatics, intimately connected with understanding protein chemistry and dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning, combined with the availability of genomic data for inferring co-evolutionary patterns, provide a new approach to protein structure prediction that is complementary to longstanding physics-based approaches. The outstanding performance of AlphaFold 2 in the recent Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14) experiment demonstrates the remarkable power of deep learning in structure prediction. In this perspective, we focus on the key features of AlphaFold 2, including its use of (i) attention mechanisms and Transformers to capture long-range dependencies, (ii) symmetry principles to facilitate reasoning over protein structures in three dimensions and (iii) end-to-end differentiability as a unifying framework for learning from protein data. The rules of protein folding are ultimately encoded in the physical principles that underpin it; to conclude, the implications of having a powerful computational model for structure prediction that does not explicitly rely on those principles are discussed.},

Here, the CpHMD implemented in the Amber molecular dynamics package has been employed (Huang, Y. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2018, 58, 1372−1383). Notably, to avoid discontinuities at the boundary, grid charges are proposed to represent protein electrostatics. We show that the prediction accuracy by DeepKa is close to that by CpHMD benchmarking simulations, validating DeepKa as an efficient protein pKa predictor. In addition, the training and validation sets created in this study can be applied to the development of machine learning-based protein pKa predictors in the future. Finally, the grid charge representation is general and applicable to other topics, such as the protein–ligand binding affinity prediction.},

In aerobic aqueous solutions, the damage is commonly mediated by the hydroxyl free radicals generated from water, resulting in formation of protein radicals. Protein damage is especially significant in biological systems, because proteins are the most abundant targets of the radiation-generated radicals, the hydroxyl radical-protein reaction is fast, and the damage usually results in loss of their biological function. Under physiological conditions, proteins are initially oxidized to carbon-centered radicals, which can propagate the damage to other molecules. The most effective endogenous antioxidants, ascorbate, GSH, and urate, are unable to prevent all of the damage under the common condition of oxidative stress. In a promising development, recent work demonstrates the potential of polyphenols, their metabolites, and other aromatic compounds to repair protein radicals by the fast formation of less damaging radical adducts, thus potentially preventing the formation of a cascade of new reactive species.},

abstract = {The green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a biomolecule used in many biological applications such as biomarkers and biosensors, which require high purity levels. It is usually obtained from recombinant Escherichia coli strains, which also produces other endogenous proteins, demanding multiple purification steps, and consequently, increasing the overall costs to obtain pure GFP. Simpler and cheaper purification methods like Aqueous Biphasic Systems (ABS) were already successfully applied to purify GFP at lab scale. Therefore, the development of automatized industrially compatible purification platforms, such as countercurrent chromatography using ABS, can potentially improve the GFP production. This work studied the continuous purification of the variant enhanced GFP (EGFP) by applying ABS composed of polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000), sodium polyacrylate (NaPA 8000) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) as electrolyte. An initial screening was carried by changing the electrolyte content in the ABS. The increase of this condition has demonstrated an increase on the EGFP partition for the PEG-rich phase. The most efficient ABS and, at the same time, with the most appropriate conditions, namely the system composed of 15 wt% PEG 8000 + 4.5 wt% NaPA 8000 + 2.5 wt% Na2SO4 was chosen and applied on the fast centrifugal partition chromatography (FCPC). After optimization, the best operational conditions were identified, i.e. a flow rate of 2.5 mL.min−1 and rotation speed of 2000 rpm at ascending mode, and the best results obtained, meaning a purification of 89.93% and a recovery yield of 82.3%, confirming the potential of FCPC to the continuous purification of EGFP.},

abstract = {Lysozyme hydrolyzes the glycosidic bonds between N -acetylmuramic acid and N -acetylglucosamine in peptidoglycans located in the bacterial cell wall. The mechanism of the hydrolysis reaction of lysozyme was first studied more than 50 years ago; however, it has not yet been fully elucidated and various mechanisms are still being investigated. One reaction system that has commonly been proposed is that the lysozyme intermediate undergoes covalent ligand binding during hydrolysis. However, these findings resulted from experiments performed under laboratory conditions using fluorine-based ligands, which facilitate the formation of covalent bonds between the ligands and the catalytic side chain of lysozyme. More recently, high-resolution X-ray structural analysis was used to study the complex of lysozyme with an N -acetylglucosamine tetramer. As a result, the carboxyl group of Asp52 was found to form a relatively strong hydrogen-bond network and had difficulty binding covalently to C1 of the carbohydrate ring. To confirm this hydrogen-bond network, neutron test measurements were successfully performed to a resolution of better than 1.9 {\AA}.},

The pH and the electrochemical environments are decisive factors to define the effective pKa of amino acids and, therefore, the protonation state. However, they are poorly considered in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. To deal with this problem, constant pH Molecular Dynamics (cpHMD) methods have been developed in recent decades, demonstrating a great ability to consider the effective pKa of amino acids within complex structures. Nonetheless, there are very few studies that assess the effect of these approaches in the conformational sampling. In a previous work of our research group, we detected strengths and weaknesses of the discrete cpHMD method implemented in AMBER when simulating capped tripeptides in implicit solvent. Now, we progressed this assessment by including explicit solvation in these peptides. To analyze more in depth the scope of the reported limitations, we also carried out simulations of oligopeptides with distinct positions of the titratable amino acids. Our study showed that the explicit solvation model does not improve the previously noted weaknesses and, furthermore, the separation of the titratable amino acids in oligopeptides can minimize them, thus providing guidelines to improve the conformational sampling in the cpHMD simulations.},

abstract = {X-ray-based techniques are a powerful tool in structural biology but the radiation-induced chemistry that results can be detrimental and may mask an accurate structural understanding. In the crystallographic case, cryocooling has been employed as a successful mitigation strategy but also has its limitations including the trapping of non-biological structural states. Crystallographic and solution studies performed at physiological temperatures can reveal otherwise hidden but relevant conformations, but are limited by their increased susceptibility to radiation damage. In this case, chemical additives that scavenge the species generated by radiation can mitigate damage but are not always successful and the mechanisms are often unclear. Using a protein designed to undergo a large-scale structural change from breakage of a disulfide bond, radiation damage can be monitored with small-angle X-ray scattering. Using this, we have quantitatively evaluated how three scavengers commonly used in crystallographic experiments – sodium nitrate, cysteine, and ascorbic acid – perform in solution at 10°C. Sodium nitrate was the most effective scavenger and completely inhibited fragmentation of the disulfide bond at a lower concentration (500 µ M ) compared with cysteine (∼5 m M ) while ascorbic acid performed best at 5 m M but could only reduce fragmentation by ∼75% after a total accumulated dose of 792 Gy. The relative effectiveness of each scavenger matches their reported affinities for solvated electrons. Saturating concentrations of each scavenger shifted fragmentation from first order to a zeroth-order process, perhaps indicating the direct contribution of photoabsorption. The SAXS-based method can detect damage at X-ray doses far lower than those accessible crystallographically, thereby providing a detailed picture of scavenger processes. The solution results are also in close agreement with what is known about scavenger performance and mechanism in a crystallographic setting and suggest that a link can be made between the damage phenomenon in the two scenarios. Therefore, our engineered approach might provide a platform for more systematic and comprehensive screening of radioprotectants that can directly inform mitigation strategies for both solution and crystallographic experiments, while also clarifying fundamental radiation damage mechanisms.},

Since early TR-SFX experiments were conducted at XFELs, it has been largely reported in the literature that time-resolved X-ray experiments at synchrotrons are no longer feasible or are impractical due to the severe technical limitations of these radiation sources. The transfer of the serial crystallography approach to newest synchrotrons upgraded for higher flux density and with beamlines using sophisticated focusing optics, submicron beam diameters and fast low-noise photon-counting detectors offers a way to overcome these difficulties opening new and exciting possibilities. In fact, there is an increasing amount of publications reporting new findings in structural dynamics of protein macromolecules by using time resolved crystallography from microcrystals at synchrotron sources. This review gathers information to provide an overview of the recent work and the advances made in this filed in the past years, as well as outlines future perspectives at the next generation of synchrotron sources and the upcoming compact pulsed X-ray sources.},

In view of the significant influence of LLPS on nucleation mechanism and kinetics, which is associated with the regulation of crystalline products, we therefore review the research progress of LLPS in the crystallization process in the last 30 years and attempt to summarize the reasons for LLPS from the perspectives of thermodynamics, properties of solvent and solute, short-range attraction, and the nucleation pathway. Furthermore, we highlight the role of the dense liquid intermediate phase in nucleation by revisiting the progress of nucleation theory, especially the classical nucleation and two-step nucleation theory. Finally, we also discuss how to regulate the crystallization outcome with desired properties of crystals in the LLPS process (crystal size distribution, polymorphism, crystal habit, etc.) so as to inspire people about why and how to promote or avoid LLPS during the crystallization process.},

abstract = {In the method of X-ray footprinting mass spectrometry (XFMS), proteins at micromolar concentration in solution are irradiated with a broadband X-ray source, and the resulting hydroxyl radical modifications are characterized using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to determine sites of solvent accessibility. These data are used to infer structural changes in proteins upon interaction with other proteins, folding, or ligand binding. XFMS is typically performed under aerobic conditions; dissolved molecular oxygen in solution is necessary in many, if not all, the hydroxyl radical modifications that are generally reported. In this study we investigated the result of X-ray induced modifications to three different proteins under aerobic versus low oxygen conditions, and correlated the extent of damage with dose calculations. We observed a concentration-dependent protecting effect at higher protein concentration for a given X-ray dose. For the typical doses used in XFMS experiments there was minimal X-ray induced aggregation and fragmentation, but for higher doses we observed formation of covalent higher molecular weight oligomers, as well as fragmentation, which was affected by the amount of dissolved oxygen in solution. The higher molecular weight products in the form of dimers, trimers, and tetramers were present in all sample preparations, and, upon X-ray irradiation, these oligomers became non-reducible as seen in SDS-PAGE. The results provide an important contribution to the large body of X-ray radiation damage literature in structural biology research, and will specifically help inform the future planning of XFMS, and well as X-ray crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering experiments.},

abstract = {The pH-dependence of enzyme fold stability and catalytic activity is a fundamentally dynamic, structural property which is difficult to study. The challenges and expense of investigating dynamic, atomic scale behavior experimentally means that computational methods, particularly constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD), are well situated tools for this. However, these methods often struggle with affordable sampling of sufficiently long time scales while also obtaining accurate pKa prediction and verifying the structures they generate. We introduce Titr-DMD, an affordable CpHMD method that combines the quasi-all-atom coarse-grained discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) method for conformational sampling with Propka for pKa prediction, to circumvent these issues. The combination enables rapid sampling on limited computational resources, while simulations are still performed on the atomic scale. We benchmark the method on a set of proteins with experimentally attested pKa and on the pH triggered conformational change in a staphylococcal nuclease mutant, a rare experimental study of such behavior. Our results show Titr-DMD to be an effective and inexpensive method to study pH-coupled protein dynamics.},

For X-ray diffraction, an in-depth study of multi-crystal small-wedge data collection single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing protocols is presented, concluding that an absorbed dose of 5 MGy per crystal was optimal to allow reliable phasing. For small-angle X-ray scattering, experiments are reported that evaluate the efficacy of three radical scavengers using a protein designed to give a clear signature of damage in the form of a large conformational change upon the breakage of a disulfide bond. The use of X-rays to induce OH radicals from the radiolysis of water for X-ray footprinting are covered in two papers. In the first, new developments and the data collection pipeline at the NSLS-II high-throughput dedicated synchrotron beamline are described, and, in the second, the X-ray induced changes in three different proteins under aerobic and low-oxygen conditions are investigated and correlated with the absorbed dose. Studies in XFEL science are represented by a report on simulations of ultrafast dynamics in protic ionic liquids, and, lastly, a broad coverage of possible methods for dose efficiency improvement in modalities using electrons is presented.

The importance of annotating the model with B factors to account for the resolvability of individual atoms in the map is illustrated.

abstract = {Diffraction data acquired from cryocooled protein crystals often include diffraction from ice. Analysis of ice diffraction from crystals of three proteins shows that the ice formed within solvent cavities during rapid cooling is comprised of a stacking-disordered mixture of hexagonal and cubic planes, with the cubic plane fraction increasing with increasing cryoprotectant concentration and increasing cooling rate. Building on the work of Thorn and coworkers [Thorn et al. (2017), Acta Cryst. D 73 , 729–727], a revised metric is defined for detecting ice from deposited protein structure-factor data, and this metric is validated using full-frame diffraction data from the Integrated Resource for Reproducibility in Macromolecular Crystallography. Using this revised metric and improved algorithms, an analysis of structure-factor data from a random sample of 89 827 PDB entries collected at cryogenic temperatures indicates that roughly 16% show evidence of ice contamination, and that this fraction increases with increasing solvent content and maximum solvent-cavity size. By examining the ice diffraction-peak positions at which structure-factor perturbations are observed, it is found that roughly 25% of crystals exhibit ice with primarily hexagonal character, indicating that inadequate cooling rates and/or cryoprotectant concentrations were used, while the remaining 75% show ice with a stacking-disordered or cubic character.},

abstract = {The aim of the UniProt Knowledgebase is to provide users with a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible set of protein sequences annotated with functional information. In this article, we describe significant updates that we have made over the last two years to the resource. The number of sequences in UniProtKB has risen to approximately 190 million, despite continued work to reduce sequence redundancy at the proteome level. We have adopted new methods of assessing proteome completeness and quality. We continue to extract detailed annotations from the literature to add to reviewed entries and supplement these in unreviewed entries with annotations provided by automated systems such as the newly implemented Association-Rule-Based Annotator (ARBA). We have developed a credit-based publication submission interface to allow the community to contribute publications and annotations to UniProt entries. We describe how UniProtKB responded to the COVID-19 pandemic through expert curation of relevant entries that were rapidly made available to the research community through a dedicated portal.

abstract = {Ionizing radiation damage to DNA plays a fundamental role in cancer therapy. X-ray photoelectron-spectroscopy (XPS) allows simultaneous irradiation and damage monitoring. Although water radiolysis is essential for radiation damage, all previous XPS studies were performed in vacuum. Here we present near-ambient-pressure XPS experiments to directly measure DNA damage under water atmosphere. They permit in-situ monitoring of the effects of radicals on fully hydrated double-stranded DNA. The results allow us to distinguish direct damage, by photons and secondary low-energy electrons (LEE), from damage by hydroxyl radicals or hydration induced modifications of damage pathways. The exposure of dry DNA to x-rays leads to strand-breaks at the sugar-phosphate backbone, while deoxyribose and nucleobases are less affected. In contrast, a strong increase of DNA damage is observed in water, where OH-radicals are produced. In consequence, base damage and base release become predominant, even though the number of strand-breaks increases further.},

abstract = {Nearly fifty years ago the triosephosphate isomerase enzyme, from chicken, was first determined by X-ray crystallography (Banner et al., 1975). This was achieved via a multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) phased electron-density map interpreted via a Richards box and its associated Kendrew mechanical molecular model parts (Richards, 1968). This Richards box was housed opposite my desk during my DPhil in the Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics at the University of Oxford. So, I can truly say that I once shared an office with triosephosphate isomerase! Triosephosphate isomerase was, and is, an enzyme viewed by biochemists as 'the perfect enzyme'. Knowles & Albery's (1977) early review was entitled Perfection in enzyme catalysis: the energetics of triosphosphate isomerase. The point being that the catalytic interconversion by triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (d-GAP) (Fig. 1) was diffusion limited and thereby made it a very fast enzyme catalyst. The enzyme gives a huge rate improvement (by 10 9) over the reaction rate without the enzyme and a simple organic base. Knowles & Albery (1977) also remark: 'the structure of the enzyme at high resolution has been solved (Banner et al., 1975); this confirms the existence of the unique active-site glutamate in a pocket in the enzyme, which also contains histidine and lysine residues whose detailed function will presumably emerge when the structure of the enzyme-DHAP complex is completed (Banner et al., 1975).'. As we see below, with many more X-ray crystal structures of TIM, the new study of Kelp{\v{s}}as et al. (2021), reported in this issue of IUCrJ and involving neutrons as a probe, was needed. But, first a little more history. The structure of TIM (Banner et al., 1975) also became famous as its 8 alpha-helices around an 8 beta-sheet-stranded barrel three-dimensional structure for its polypeptide fold was regularly seen in other enzymes. This became Figure 1 Triosephosphate isomerase catalyses the interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (d-GAP). Figure adapted from Alahuhta et al.

abstract = {Successful development of protein therapeutics depends critically on achieving stability under a range of conditions. A deeper understanding of the drivers of instability across different stress conditions, will enable the engineering of more robust protein scaffolds. We compared the impacts of low pH and high temperature stresses on the structure of a humanized antibody fragment (Fab) A33, using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, using a recent 2.5 {\AA} crystal structure. This revealed that low-pH induced the loss of native contacts in the domain CL. By contrast, thermal stress led to 5–7% loss of native contacts in all four domains, and simultaneous loss of >30% of native contacts in the VL-VH and CL-CH interfaces. This revealed divergent destabilising pathways under the two different stresses. The underlying cause of instability was probed using FoldX and Rosetta mutation analysis, and packing density calculations. These agreed that mutations in the CL domain, and CL-CH1 interface have the greatest potential for stabilisation of Fab A33. Several key salt bridge losses underpinned the conformational change in CL at low pH, whereas at high temperature, salt bridges became more dynamic, thus contributing to an overall destabilization. Lastly, the unfolding events at the two stress conditions exposed different predicted aggregation-prone regions (APR) to solvent, which would potentially lead to different aggregation mechanisms. Overall, our results identified the early stages of unfolding and stability-limiting regions of Fab A33, and the VH and CL domains as interesting future targets for engineering stability to both pH- and thermal-stresses simultaneously.},

abstract = {Protein-protein association is often mediated by electrostatic interactions and modulated by pH. However, experimental and computational studies have often overlooked the effect of association on the protonation state of the protein. In this work, we present a methodological approach based on constant-pH molecular dynamics (MD), which aims to provide a detailed description of a pH-dependent protein-protein association, and apply it to the dimerization of $\beta$-lactoglobulin (BLG). A selection of analyses is performed using the data generated by constant-pH MD simulations of monomeric and dimeric forms of bovine BLG, in the pH range 3-8. First, we estimate free energies of dimerization using a computationally inexpensive approach based on the Wyman-Tanford linkage theory, calculated in a new way through the use of thermodynamically based splines. The individual free energy contribution of each titratable site is also calculated, allowing for identification of relevant residues. Second, the correlations between the proton occupancies of pairs of sites are calculated (using the Pearson coefficient), and extensive networks of correlated sites are observed at acidic pH values, sometimes involving distant pairs. In general, strongly correlated sites are also slow proton exchangers and contribute significantly to the pH-dependency of the dimerization free energy. Third, we use ionic density as a fingerprint of protein charge distribution and observe electrostatic complementarity between the monomer faces that form the dimer interface, more markedly at the isoionic point (where maximum dimerization occurs) than at other pH values, which might contribute to guide the association. Finally, the pH-dependent dimerization modes are inspected using PCA, among other analyses, and two states are identified: a relaxed state at pH 4-8 (with the typical alignment of the crystallographic structure) and a compact state at pH 3-4 (with a tighter association and rotated alignment). This work shows that an approach based on constant-pH MD simulations can produce rich detailed pictures of pH-dependent protein associations, as illustrated for BLG dimerization.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations are used routinely to compute atom-istic trajectories of complex systems. Systems are simulated in various ensembles, depending on the experimental conditions one aims to mimic. While constant energy, temperature, volume, and pressure are rather straightforward to model, pH, which is an equally important parameter in experiments, is more difficult to account for in simulations. Although a constant pH algorithm based on the $\lambda$-dynamics approach by Brooks and co-workers was implemented in a fork of the GROMACS molecular dynamics program, uptake has been rather limited, presumably due to the poor scaling of that code with respect to the number of titratable sites. To overcome this limitation, we implemented an alternative scheme for interpolating the Hamiltonians of the protona-tion states that makes the constant pH molecular dynamics simulations almost as fast as a normal MD simulation with GROMACS. In addition, we implemented a simpler scheme, called multisite representation, for modeling side chains with multiple titrat-able sites, such as imidazole rings. This scheme, which is based on constraining the 1 sum of the $\lambda$-coordinates, not only reduces the complexity associated with parameter-izing the intra-molecular interactions between the sites, but is also easily extendable to other molecules with multiple titratable sites. With the combination of a more efficient interpolation scheme and multisite representation of titratable groups, we anticipate a rapid uptake of constant pH molecular dynamics simulations within the GROMACS user community.},

abstract = {Fluoride channels (Flucs) export toxic F− from the cytoplasm. Crystallography and mutagenesis have identified several conserved residues crucial for fluoride transport, but the permeation mechanism at the molecular level has remained elusive. Herein, we have applied constant-pH molecular dynamics and free-energy-sampling methods to investigate fluoride permeation through a Fluc protein from Escherichia coli. We find that fluoride is facile to permeate in its charged form, i.e., F−, by traversing through a non-bonded network. The extraordinary F− selectivity is gained by the hydrogen-bonding capability of the central binding site and the Coulombic filter at the channel entrance. The F− permeation rate calculated using an electronically polarizable force field is significantly more accurate compared with the experimental value than that calculated using a more standard additive force field, suggesting an essential role for electronic polarization in the F−–Fluc interactions.},

abstract = {Malaria remains a global health threat-over 400,000 deaths occurred in 2019. Plasmepsins are promising targets of antimalarial therapeutics; however, no inhibitors have reached the clinic. To fuel the progress, a detailed understanding of the pH-and ligand-dependent conformational dynamics of plasmepsins is needed. Here we present the continuous constant pH molecular dynamics study of the prototypical plasmepsin II and its complexed form with a substrate analogue. The simulations revealed that the catalytic dyads D34 and D214 are highly coupled in the apo protein and that the pepstatin binding enhances the difference in proton affinity, making D34 the general base and D214 the general acid. The simulations showed that the flap adopts an open state regardless of pH; however, upon pepstatin binding the flap can close or open depending on the protonation state of D214. These and other data are discussed and compared with the off-targets human cathepsin D and renin. This study lays the groundwork for a systematic investigation of pH-and ligand-modulated dynamics of the entire family of plasmepsins to help design more potent and selective inhibitors.},

abstract = {Radiation damage remains one of the major bottlenecks to accurate structure solution in protein crystallography. It can induce structural and chemical changes in protein crystals, and is hence an important consideration when assessing the quality and biological veracity of crystal structures in repositories like the Protein Data Bank (PDB). However, detection of radiation damage artefacts has traditionally proved very challenging. To address this, here we introduce the B net metric. B net summarises in a single value the extent of damage suffered by a crystal structure by comparing the B -factor values of damage-prone and non-damage-prone atoms in a similar local environment. After validating that B net successfully detects damage in 23 different crystal structures previously characterised as damaged, we calculate B net values for 93,978 PDB crystal structures. Our metric highlights a range of damage features, many of which would remain unidentified by the other summary statistics typically calculated for PDB structures.},

abstract = {Structure determination by cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) provides information on structural heterogeneity and ensembles at atomic resolution. To obtain cryo-EM images of macromolecules, the samples are first rapidly cooled down to cryogenic temperatures. To what extent the structural ensemble is perturbed during cooling is currently unknown. Here, to quantify the effects of cooling, we combined continuum model calculations of the temperature drop, molecular dynamics simulations of a ribosome complex before and during cooling with kinetic models. Our results suggest that three effects markedly contribute to the narrowing of the structural ensembles: thermal contraction, reduced thermal motion within local potential wells, and the equilibration into lower free-energy conformations by overcoming separating free-energy barriers. During cooling, barrier heights below 10 kJ/mol were found to be overcome, which is expected to reduce B-factors in ensembles imaged by cryo-EM. Our approach now enables the quantification of the heterogeneity of room-temperature ensembles from cryo-EM structures.},

We used StayGold to image the dynamics of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with high spatiotemporal resolution over several minutes using structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and observed substantially less photobleaching than with a GFP variant optimized for stability in the ER. Using StayGold fusions and SIM, we also imaged the dynamics of mitochondrial fusion and fission and mapped the viral spike proteins in fixed cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. As StayGold is a dimer, we created a tandem dimer version that allowed us to observe the dynamics of microtubules and the excitatory post-synaptic density in neurons. StayGold will substantially reduce the limitations imposed by photobleaching, especially in live cell or volumetric imaging.},

Originally established in 1971 as a resource for protein crystallographers to freely exchange data, today PDB data drive research and education across scientific disciplines. In 2011, the online portal PDB-101 was launched to support teachers, students, and the general public in PDB archive exploration (pdb101.rcsb.org). Maintained by the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics PDB, PDB-101 aims to help train the next generation of PDB users and to promote the overall importance of structural biology and protein science to nonexperts. Regularly published features include the highly popular Molecule of the Month series, 3D model activities, molecular animation videos, and educational curricula. Materials are organized into various categories (Health and Disease, Molecules of Life, Biotech and Nanotech, and Structures and Structure Determination) and searchable by keyword. A biennial health focus frames new resource creation and provides topics for annual video challenges for high school students. Web analytics document that PDB-101 materials relating to fundamental topics (e.g., hemoglobin, catalase) are highly accessed year-on-year. In addition, PDB-101 materials created in response to topical health matters (e.g., Zika, measles, coronavirus) are well received. PDB-101 shows how learning about the diverse shapes and functions of PDB structures promotes understanding of all aspects of biology, from the central dogma of biology to health and disease to biological energy.},

abstract = {This article reports the interaction between a synthetic statin, fluvastatin with bovine milk protein, $\beta$-lactoglobulin (BLG) through docking, constant pH molecular dynamics simulation (cpHMD) and binding free energy calculations. Docking provides the best fitted binding mode of the ligand with the receptor. We have carried out MD simulations of the protein and protein-ligand complex at two different pH viz. 7.0 and 1.5. We have found that the protein shows more compact behavior at pH 1.5 and this behavior is more prominent on complexation with the ligand. In support of this we have utilized the properties viz. root mean square deviations, root mean square fluctuations, radius of gyration, protein-ligand hydrogen bond and binding free energy calculations. Calculation of radius of gyration shows that the value decreases from 14.51 {\AA} to 14.03 {\AA} on complexation at pH 1.5. Calculations of hydrogen bonds at pH 1.5 confirms that hydrogen bonding interactions of the binding residues of the protein with the ligand provides stability to the complex. We have used molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) method to estimate binding free energies of the protein with the ligand. MMGBSA calculations suggest that there is favorable binding interactions between the protein and the ligand with major contributions from Van der Waals interactions. We have found that the net average binding free energy is −29.394 kcal/mol that reveals a favorable binding interactions of BLG with the ligand. This study suggests that in spite of the acidic environment in the stomach BLG can act as a carrier for the acid-sensitive drug molecules such as fluvastatin because of its highly stable conformational behavior in the acidic pH.},
